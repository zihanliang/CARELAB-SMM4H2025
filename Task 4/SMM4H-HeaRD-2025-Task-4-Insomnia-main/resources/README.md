# Insomnia Rules

The complete set of rules utilized for determining whether a patient is likely to suffer from insomnia can be found in the [`Insomnia_Rules.md`](Insomnia_Rules.md) document.

## Drug Mentions
Key points to consider when annotating medications:

- Only drugs specified in Rules B and C are considered as primary and secondary insomnia medications, respectively.

- Medications not listed in these rules, but explicitly prescribed for sleep, such as "Serax prescribed for sleep", should be included under Definition 1 for difficulty sleeping.

- Drugs listed under Rules B and C, but mentioned in the clinical notes by their alternative brand names (e.g., Ambien for Zolpidem, Benadryl for Diphenhydramine) must also be recognized and considered.
