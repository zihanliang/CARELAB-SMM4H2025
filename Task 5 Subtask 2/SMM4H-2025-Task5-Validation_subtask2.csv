Most events the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) dealt with in the first quarter of 2019 involved a biological hazard. Five were because of Salmonella, three each because of Listeria monocytogenes and E. coli, and one each involving Clostridium botulinum and Ciguatera toxin. INFOSAN, which is managed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the World Health Organization (WHO), also handled a physical hazard such as glass in three cases, and one each for metal and plastic. Another incident involved a chemical hazard (Hydrocyanic Acid), and another was about undeclared peanut ingredients. The 21 incidents in 1Q this year are similar to the 19 recorded for October to December 2018. All WHO regions were covered including Europe, the Americas, Western Pacific, Africa, Eastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia. Food categories mostly involved, in order, were milk and dairy products, nuts and oilseeds, cereals and cereal-based products, fish and other seafood, fruit and fruit products, sugar and confectioneries, vegetables and vegetable products, food for infants and small children, products for special nutritional use, snacks, desserts, and other foods and starchy roots and tubers. Role in managing Salmonella Poona outbreakOfficials reported that during the quarter, a multi-country outbreak of Salmonella Poona infections in France, Belgium and Luxembourg was linked to consumption of infant formula products manufactured for at one factory in Spain. Products linked to the outbreak were distributed globally. The implicated powdered milk formula was made at the Industrias Lacteas Asturianas SA (ILAS) factory in Anleo, a municipality in the Spanish province of Asturias. The factory was the same as the one in a 2010 and 2011 incident. Salmonella Poona strains in the two outbreaks were genetically related. The 2010-11 outbreak linked to powdered milk sickened almost 300 infants in Spain. In February, Peter K. Ben Embarek, INFOSAN management, department of food safety and zoonoses at WHO, spoke to Food Safety News about INFOSAN's involvement. The INFOSAN Secretariat worked with INFOSAN emergency contact points in Spain and France to identify and share distribution details with network members in recipient countries. The secretariat also worked with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) during the outbreak. Information sharing through INFOSAN helped with a recall of affected infant formula products and with identification of secondary international distribution. No cases of illness were reported to the INFOSAN Secretariat in countries outside of Europe. INFOSAN also exhibited during the first International Food Safety Conference, organized by the FAO, the WHO and the African Union in February in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The second part of the event, the International Forum on Food Safety and Trade, is set for April 23 and 24 in Geneva, Switzerland, at the World Trade Organization (WTO). In January, a study began to look at experiences of INFOSAN members and better understand the network's role in mitigating the burden of foodborne illness worldwide. It will examine access to and usage of the INFOSAN community website, explore barriers and facilitators to active participation in the network, determine perceptions about the utility of INFOSAN to mitigate foodborne illness, and scrutinize if and how participation creates value for members.

The recall is in response to the CDC and FDA's investigation of 13 illnesses caused by Salmonella, confirmed to date. As of today, Jensen Tuna's ground tuna samples were found negative for Salmonella. The recalled tuna product was distributed from November 30, 2018, to March 15, 2019. Jensen Tuna sold the product to wholesalers in Connecticut, Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, North Dakota, New York, and Washington; ""These wholesalers further distribute the product to restaurants and retail locations."" The recalled tuna product is individually packaged in clear plastic 1-pound bags and is sold in white wax 20-pound boxes. According to the recall notice, the product is only sold as a wholesale case with twenty bags in each case. The cases are labeled with the production lot codes of z266, z271, and z272. No other tuna products are impacted or part of this recall. ""Restaurants and retailers should check with their suppliers and not sell or serve recalled frozen ground tuna, and should wash and sanitize locations where recalled ground tuna was stored,"" the recall notice said. Consumers with concerns should ask their restaurants and retailers whether the tuna dish they are purchasing contained the recalled ground tuna. The FDA noted that it is unlikely that the recalled ground tuna was sold directly to consumers in grocery stores, and likely that it was used in food dishes sold by restaurants or retailers. As of April 16, the FDA, CDC and state and local partners, ""is investigating a multi-state outbreak of Salmonella Newport illnesses linked to frozen ground tuna from Jensen Tuna, sourced from JK Fish of Vietnam."" Through interviews with ill people, CDC and state partners collected and analyzed information that allowed them to identify frozen ground tuna as a possible source of illness. The FDA worked with state partners to trace the distribution of frozen ground tuna from individual case-patients back to Jensen Tuna. Advice to consumers Anyone who has eaten any of the implicated tuna and developed symptoms of Salmonella infection should seek medical attention and tell their doctors about their possible exposure. Anyone who has recently eaten ground tuna products at a restaurant and developed symptoms should take the same precautions. Symptoms usually include fever, diarrhea that is often bloody, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Infections from Salmonella bacteria can become very serious, and are sometimes fatal. Those at highest risk of serious infection include young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems such as cancer patients or transplant recipients. In rare circumstances, infection from Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections, endocarditis and arthritis.

In total, there were 515 confirmed cases of Salmonella Newport illness linked to this outbreak.  In the United States, at least 1,012 people had been confirmed as outbreak patients, as of Aug. 31. The Salmonella Newport outbreak has sickened people from 47 U.S. states. The outbreaks in both countries have been linked to California-based Thomson International Inc. In Canada, patient counts by province are as follows: British Columbia with 121, Alberta with 293, Saskatchewan with 35, Manitoba with 26, Ontario with 14, Quebec with 25, and Prince Edward Island with 1. Individuals became sick between mid-June and late-August 2020. Seventy-nine people were hospitalized. Three people died, but Salmonella did not contribute to the cause of these deaths, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. Investigations by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration initially showed a link between the illnesses and red onions, but because of the way onions are grown, harvested, and packed other onion types, such as white, yellow, or sweet yellow, are also likely to be contaminated. Public health officials in the United States report that 34 illness clusters have been identified in 13 states of the implicated states.Information was collected on 23 of the 34 clusters at restaurants and grocery stores. Information from these clusters shows that many ill people ate red onions and other types of onions. Investigations conducted by U.S. state and federal officials determined that all 23 restaurants and grocery stores specifically identified as having served or sold red, yellow, or white onions. Seventeen of the 23  (74 percent) served red onions, 13 (57 percent) served yellow onions, and 10 (43 percent) served white onions.

As of Sept 21, there were 279 confirmed patients across 29 states, according to the Centers For Disease and Prevention. The agency first identified the outbreak on Sept 2 when there were 20 sick people. The source of the outbreak has remained a mystery as more and more people across the country have become infected. Testing has finally found the outbreak strain in a food container. ""The outbreak strain of Salmonella Oranienburg was found in a sample taken from a takeout condiment cup containing cilantro and lime. The sick person reported that the condiment container also contained onions, but none were left in the cup when it was tested,"" according to the CDC. ""Because multiple food items were present in the container and in the sample that was tested, it is not possible to know which food item was contaminated. We are using this information in conjunction with other available information to help narrow the list of possible foods linked to illness."" Illnesses started on dates ranging from Aug. 3 to Sept. 13. Sick people range in age from less than 1 year to 89 years, with a median age of 35, and 59 percent are female. Of 86 people with information available, 26 have been hospitalized and no deaths have been reported. ""The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for Salmonella. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak,"" according to the CDC. State and local public health officials are interviewing people about the foods they ate in the week before they got sick. CDC is analyzing the data and has not identified a specific food item as a potential source of this outbreak.  Several groups of people in ""subclusters"" at restaurants in multiple states have been identified. These subclusters are groups of people who do not know one another who ate at the same restaurant and got sick. Investigating these subclusters can sometimes help identify a food item eaten by all of the sick people that could be the source of the outbreak.

The product is sold in 1.5oz, 2.75oz, and 7oz bags, and clearly marked with a ""Sell by Date"" of the following, printed on the front of the bag. No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this occurrence. If any consumers have concerns about illness in connection with this product, they should contact a physician immediately. The potential for contamination was discovered after routine testing conducting by the seasoning provider. The production of the product has been suspended while the FDA and the seasoning company continue to investigate the source of the problem. Consumers who have purchased Ballreich's BAR-B-Q, with any of the above sell-by date(s), are urged to not consume the recalled product. About Salmonella Food contaminated with Salmonella bacteria does not usually look, smell, or taste spoiled. Anyone can become sick with a Salmonella infection. Infants, children, seniors, and people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of serious illness because their immune systems are fragile, according to the CDC. Anyone who has eaten any recalled products and developed symptoms of Salmonella food poisoning should seek medical attention. Sick people should tell their doctors about the possible exposure to Salmonella bacteria because special tests are necessary to diagnose salmonellosis. Salmonella infection symptoms can mimic other illnesses, frequently leading to misdiagnosis. Symptoms of Salmonella infection can include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating contaminated food. Otherwise, healthy adults are usually sick for four to seven days. In some cases, however, diarrhea may be so severe that patients require hospitalization. Older adults, children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients, are more likely to develop a severe illness and serious, sometimes life-threatening conditions. Some people get infected without getting sick or showing any symptoms. However, they may still spread the infections to others. (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

The Oct. 14 CDC update continues: Since the last update on October 6, 2015, 35 more ill people have been reported from 14 states. Illnesses that occurred after September 15, 2015 might not be reported yet. A series of events occurs between the time a person is infected and the time public health officials can determine that the person is part of an outbreak. This means that there will be a delay between when a person gets sick and confirmation that he or she is part of an outbreak. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks. Please see the Timeline for Reporting Cases of Salmonella Infection for more details. Also, cucumbers have a shelf life of up to 14 days.

Fifteen confirmed cases were announced Friday in New Mexico, as well as 11 confirmed cases (with two suspected) reported from eight counties in Montana. Thursday's total case count was 285, and the total on Friday was said to have climbed higher than that. ""I know that it's over 300 now,"" Mark DiMenna, deputy director of the Albuquerque Environmental Health Department, told Food Safety News. He said the breakdown of the 285 S.

He said that Albuquerque health inspectors come in from the field on Friday and contacted anybody in grocery stores or restaurants who might have received the Mexican cucumbers. ""We contacted anybody who we knew had gotten them and asked them to pull them off the shelves,"" he said, adding that barring an official recall, product removal would be on a voluntary basis. While DiMenna wouldn't name the distributor involved, he noted that several outlets in his area had already been contacted by them. ""It's an indication of the scale of that distributor,"" he said. On Friday, a San Diego produce distributor, Andrew &amp; Williamson Fresh Produce, recalled cucumbers imported from Mexico for Salmonella risk. Andrew &amp; Williamson also supplies vegetables to Red Lobster and In-And-Out restaurants, among others, according to an Oklahoma City TV station. California health department officials stated that Andrew &amp; Williamson had initiated a voluntary recall of their garden cucumbers after being informed of the epidemiologic association between these cucumbers and the Salmonella Poona outbreak. ""The recalled garden cucumbers can be identified in distribution channels as 'Limited Edition' brand pole grown cucumbers. The labeling on these cases indicates the product was grown and packed by Rancho Don Juanito in Mexico. These cucumbers were distributed between August 1 - September 3, 2015,"" the department stated. The Mexican cucumbers being linked to the current S. Poona outbreak are not the long, thin ones that come wrapped in plastic (English cucumbers) nor the small pickle-shaped type (Persian cucumbers). They are the thick-skinned, unwrapped type of garden-variety cucumbers and were sent to grocery stores and restaurants in New Mexico and other states through a produce distributor. CDC reported Friday that several state health and agriculture departments are collecting leftover cucumbers from restaurants and grocery stores where ill people reported eating or shopping to test for the presence of Salmonella. ""The San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency isolated Salmonella from cucumbers collected during a visit to the Andrew &amp; Williamson Fresh Produce facility. DNA 'fingerprinting' is being conducted to determine the PFGE pattern of the Salmonella isolated from these cucumbers. Results of additional product testing will be reported when available,"" CDC stated. The New Mexico Health Department noted in its Friday announcement that officials there were working with CDC, FDA, the New Mexico Environment Department, the Albuquerque Environmental Health Department, and multiple other state health departments on the outbreak investigation. According to the state health department there, the 15 New Mexico cases are seven residents of Bernalillo County, two residents of Dona Ana County, two residents of Sandoval County, and one resident from McKinley, Santa Fe, and Valencia counties, respectively, with one case of unknown residence at this time. Several of the New Mexicans sickened were hospitalized, ranged in age from 1 to 65 years of age, and approximately 60 percent are female. Illness onset ranged from July 30 to late August, according to the health department. New Mexico health officials recommended that New Mexicans not buy, sell, eat, or serve cucumbers grown commercially in Mexico until additional information is available from the CDC and FDA. ""If you have any concerns we recommend that you ask your retail grocer where the cucumbers you purchased were grown. When in doubt as to their origin, do not eat them, and throw them out,"" they stated. California health officials sent out a photo of a box of the recalled cucumbers, noting that, ""It is unlikely that cucumbers in retail grocery stores will have any identifying brand information. CDPH recommends that consumers check with their grocer to determine if the cucumbers they purchased are impacted by this warning."" People who are at high risk for Salmonella infection include: infants, elderly, those with compromised immune systems, including persons on immunosuppressive therapies or medications, and pregnant women. Healthy adults rarely develop severe illness. It is important for people at high risk to follow the standard CDC guidance about Salmonella. People can decrease their risk of Salmonella infection through proper food handling and preparation and by practicing proper hand washing and hygiene practices. Eating food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, an uncommon but potentially serious infection. Salmonellosis is characterized by an acute onset of headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and sometimes vomiting. Dehydration, especially among infants, may be severe. This is not the first Salmonella outbreak linked to cucumbers. An outbreak of Salmonella Newport in 2014 affected a total of 275 people in 29 states and the District of Columbia, with illness onsets occurring during May 20 to Sept. 30, 2014. That outbreak was linked to cucumbers grown in the Delmarva region of Maryland's Eastern Shore.  (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

",N/A,Tomatoes,Salmonella Newport contamination,Salmonella infections,At least 14 confirmed infections,Highland (KS) United Methodist Presbyterian Church2444,"Top Quality Dog Food of Hyattsville, MD, is recalling ""Beef HVM"" 1-pound packages because of potential Salmonella and  Listeria monocytogenes contamination. Both Salmonella and Listeria can affect animals eating the product and there is risk to humans handling contaminated products, especially if they have not thoroughly washed their hands after having contact with the products or any surfaces exposed to these products. The contamination was found after a state surveillance sample revealed the presence of Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes, in some 1-pound. packages of Beef HVM. The remaining ""Beef HVM"" batch in the firm's possession has been quarantined and it has discontinued the distribution of this batch. The recalled ""Beef HVM"" was distributed in Washington D.C., Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Miami, Connecticut and South Carolina. The products were also distributed through mail order and direct delivery from July 27 to Aug. 2.  Recalled product: As of the posting of this recall, no illnesses have been reported in connection with the recalled product. Customers who received the product are urged to dispose of it immediately. About Salmonella infections in humansFood contaminated with Salmonella bacteria does not usually look, smell, or taste spoiled. Anyone can become sick with a Salmonella infection. Infants, children, seniors  and people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of serious illness because their immune systems are fragile, according to the CDC. Anyone who has come in contact with any of the recalled products and developed symptoms of Salmonella infection should seek medical attention. Sick people should tell their doctors about the possible exposure to Salmonella bacteria because special tests are necessary to diagnose salmonellosis. Salmonella infection symptoms can mimic other illnesses, frequently leading to misdiagnosis. Symptoms of Salmonella infection can include diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating contaminated food. Otherwise, healthy adults are usually sick for four to seven days. In some cases, however, diarrhea may be so severe that patients require hospitalization. Older adults, children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients, are more likely to develop severe illness and serious, sometimes life-threatening conditions. Some people get infected without getting sick or showing any symptoms. However, they may still spread the infections to others. About Listeria infectionsFood contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes may not look or smell spoiled but can still cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections. Anyone who has handled any recalled product and developed symptoms of Listeria infection should seek medical treatment and tell their doctors about the possible Listeria exposure. Also, anyone who has handled any of the recalled products should monitor themselves for symptoms during the coming weeks because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to Listeria for symptoms of listeriosis to develop. Symptoms of Listeria infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache, and neck stiffness. Specific laboratory tests are required to diagnose Listeria infections, which can mimic other illnesses. Pregnant women, the elderly, young children, and people such as cancer patients who have weakened immune systems are particularly at risk of serious illnesses, life-threatening infections, and other complications. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, their infections can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or even stillbirth.

One of the hottest spots in the country for Hepatitis A  is Kentucky where ten counties are reporting some 692 confirmed cases and six deaths from the highly contagious disease. Each of those ten counties was each slated to receive funding for 1,000 doses of vaccine. The University of Lousiville and International Travel Clinic have vaccinated about 1,500 food service workers at 75 Lousiville restaurants.   Louisville has also targeted produce workers at area grocery stores for vaccines.   ""The outbreak remains centered among those who use drugs-not just IV users-and among the homeless population who have less access to hand washing and hygiene facilities,"" said Louisville Metro Department of Health and Wellness spokesman Dave Langdon. The last serious Hep A outbreak in Louisville occurred in 1988. The communicable disease of the liver is caused by a virus that brings on fatigue, low appetite, stomach pain and nausea within two months after being infected.  While the current Hepatitis A cases may have started out with homeless populations and drug users, it can easily spread to others from ill restaurant and food service workers. Michigan has recorded 837 confirmed cases of Hepatitis A since August 2016, resulting in 27 deaths. Michigan's may be the worst Hep A outbreak in the U.S. over this period of time.  A check found as many as 35 workers at metro Detroit restaurants were positive for the virus and may have spread it to diners without their knowledge. Like many others, the Wayne County Health Department and City of Detroit's Health Department are urging the vaccination of all food handlers. It's bad enough that Indiana warned Hoosiers not to visit Michigan without being vaccinated. Michigan recommends all children get vaccinated, beginning as early as age 1. Other adults should get vaccinated if they are: Anyone exposed to the virus should get vaccinated within 14 days to reduce the likelihood of contracting the virus. Michigan has not yet targeted food handers as a primary target for vaccines, except in high-density areas. Two West Virginia counties, Kanawha and Putnam, report a total of 80 recent cases of Hepatitis A.   One of those involved a food service worker at O'Charley's Restaurant and Bar in Barboursville, causing concern for customers who dined at there between May 6 and 13.  Another 14 Hep A cases are reported in Cabell County, WV. Food Safety News recently contacted health officials in each of the 50 states asking about the incidence of Hepatitis A cases. Not all states provided all of the information requested. Most gave only ""preliminary"" counts for 2017 and 2018. Those findings can be found here.

(Photo illustration) As of Thursday, 72 cases had been confirmed in the state, said Press Officer Christine Mann. That's up from the 55 cases reported Monday in a health advisory from the state health department. ""Within the past month, 55 cases of Cyclospora infection have been reported to the Texas Department of State Health Services,"" according to the advisory from state Health Commissioner Dr. John Hellerstedt. ""Rapid reporting to public health, enabling prompt investigation to identify possible common exposures, is essential to preventing additional cases of cyclosporiasis this year."" State officials are recommending a series of lab tests for everyone who has symptoms of Cyclospora infection. ""Diagnosis of cyclosporiasis requires submission of stool specimens for 'Ova and Parasite' testing with additional specific orders for Cyclospora identification. A single negative stool specimen does not exclude the diagnosis; three specimens are optimal,"" according to the advisory. Symptoms usually begin two days to two weeks after ingestion of Cyclospora oocysts in contaminated food or water. Profuse diarrhea can last weeks to months and may relapse. Additional symptoms may include anorexia, fatigue, weight loss, abdominal cramps, bloating, increased gas, nausea, vomiting and low-grade fever. In recent years, the U.S. and Texas in particular has seen an uptick of Cyclospora parasite infections in the summer months. So far, Texas officials have not identified a common exposure source, but past outbreaks have been linked to fresh produce. ""Past outbreaks in the U.S. have been associated with consumption of imported fresh produce, including fresh cilantro, pre-packaged salad mix, raspberries, basil, snow peas, and mesclun lettuce,"" the state health department reported. ""Thorough washing of fresh produce is recommended, but may not eliminate the risk of transmission since Cyclospora can be difficult to wash off all types of produce.

State Veterinarian Dr. Annette Jones announced the recall and quarantine today in a public alert. She warned consumers about the dangers in the alert. There is concern that some people may have unused portions of the unpasteurized milk in their homes. ""Consumers are strongly urged to dispose of any product remaining in their refrigerators that were purchased or received on June 19 through June 30, or any product with a code date marked on the container of July 9 or earlier,"" Jones said. The affected raw milk is distributed in one-gallon plastic jugs under the labels ""Valley Milk Simply Bottled Raw Milk"" and ""DESI MILK Raw Milk."" The California Department of Food and Agriculture found the campylobacter bacteria in a routine sample of packaged products collected at the Valley Milk Simply Bottled production and packaging facility. No illnesses have been reported to date. It is against federal law to engage in interstate sales of raw milk, but some states allow the sale of it within their borders. California allows the sale of unpasteurized, raw milk at retail stores, but warning signs must be posted. Anyone who has consumed any of the recalled raw milk should monitor themselves for symptoms of Campylobacter infection. Children who were served the milk should also be monitored for illness. Symptoms of campylobacteriosis include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever. The illness usually occurs 2 to 5 days after exposure to campylobacter and lasts about a week. In some people with compromised immune systems, it can cause a serious, life-threatening infection. A small percentage of people may have joint pain and swelling after infection. Also, a rare disease called Guillain-Barre syndrome that causes weakness and paralysis can occur several weeks after the initial illness.

That is one more reported case since Thursday. Four people have been hospitalized. Meanwhile, the Washington State Department of Health has revised its case count down by one person and, as of Friday, Nov, 6, noted 28 related illnesses and 10 hospitalizations in that state, so the total between the two states remains at 41 illnesses. In a Nov. 5 update on this outbreak from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the federal agency reported 40 related cases of E. coli O26 (28 in WA and 12 in OR), 10 hospitalizations in WA and two in OR. CDC's latest update stated that isolates from 10 of those sickened (seven from WA and three from OR) have been uploaded to the PulseNet database. All 10 were infected with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O26 (STEC O26) with the same DNA fingerprint. Laboratory testing is continuing, the agency added. Previous coverage follows: In an update posted Wednesday, Nov. 4, 2015, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that a total of 39 E. coli illnesses are now being reported between Washington state (29) and Oregon (10). (However, the Oregon Health Authority reported 12 cases in that state as of Nov. 3, 2015, which would mean a total of 41 cases.) ""Washington and Oregon report that most of the ill people ate at several locations of Chipotle Mexican Grill in those states before getting sick,"" CDC stated. The company has voluntarily closed 43 of its restaurants in Oregon and Washington in response to the outbreak. Several of these illnesses have been identified as Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O26 infections. The age range of those sickened to date is 1 to 67 years. Some CDC officials and others with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are assisting with the investigation, along with officials from the Washington State Department of Health and the Oregon Health Authority, CDC noted. CDC also stated that 14 of those sickened (11 in Washington and three in Oregon) have been hospitalized. There have been no reports of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and no deaths, the agency added. Laboratory testing is ongoing to determine the DNA fingerprint of the STEC O26 bacteria making people sick, according to CDC. These DNA fingerprints are being uploaded to the CDC PulseNet database as they become available. Five isolates from those sickened (two in Washington and three in Oregon) have been uploaded to the PulseNet database. All five people were infected with STEC O26 that has the same DNA fingerprint, CDC stated. CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview them. Updates will be provided when more information is available. Meanwhile, Washington and Oregon health officials are advising residents to see a health provider if they became ill recently after eating at a Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant. People with concerns about eating at a Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant location should contact their local health department. At this time, CDC stated that it does not have any information to suggest that Chipotle Mexican Grill locations in other states are affected by this outbreak. More information about signs and symptoms of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) infection is available on CDC's Signs &amp; Symptoms page. The ongoing investigation has not identified the source of these infections. CDC stated that the agency will advise the public if specific steps are identified that consumers can take to protect themselves. Most people infected with E. coli develop watery or bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps within one to 10 days, with the average three to four days. Most illnesses resolve on their own within seven days. Most people recover within a week but, rarely, some develop a severe type of kidney failure (HUS) which can begin as the diarrhea is improving and is most common in children younger than five years and the elderly.

An investigation by state and county health and environmental officials is continuing into the source of the problem. According to the Sacramento County Department of Health &amp; Human Services, 11 of those sickened reside in Sacramento County, one lives in Yolo County, and one is from Contra Costa County. One person was hospitalized. They reportedly became ill in mid-October after buying the raw apple juice for home consumption or being served it at the ranch. ""The California Food and Drug Branch is looking into it, and basically we are also working with them, but in terms of the environmental sampling that was done, sampling of the juice, that was all done by the state,"" Greg Stanton, director of the El Dorado County Environmental Management Division, told Food Safety News. (Placerville is in El Dorado County.) Ron Owens, a spokesman for the California Department of Public Health, said Friday that more information about the state's role in the outbreak investigation would be available next week. On Oct. 23, High Hill Ranch recalled its own brand of unpasteurized apple juice sold after Oct. 6 and substituted a flash-pasteurized brand of apple juice. While an Oct. 11 sample of the ranch's unpasteurized apple juice tested positive for the E. coli bacteria, other tests of the product by the California Department of Public Health were negative. Ranch owners Jerry and Michelle Visman issued a statement after the problem arose expressing regret about the illnesses, suggesting that customers may have inadvertently passed an illness along, and noting that they would no longer be handing out free samples of their apple juice. ""It was recently brought to our attention by the health department that in mid-October, some people reported getting sick after visiting our ranch. We are very sorry for this. There is some speculation that it may have been caused by drinking the apple juice. We have always offered free samples at our juice-making facility, so that the people could try the juice before buying it. Unfortunately, hundreds of people touch the filler nozzle everyday to fill the sample cups. With so many people getting sick this time of the year this very well could have spread a virus to the sample jug. We regret that for health concerns, the free samples will have to discontinue. ""We are also having the juice tested as a precaution to make absolutely sure all is well, because after making juice for 50 years and not having any complaints, we want to make sure that the good track record continues.

Jack-in-the- Box E. coli Outbreak - 1992 - 1993  708 ill, 171 hospitalized and 4 dead An outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 was linked to the consumption of hamburgers from the Jack-in-the-Box Restaurant chain. Cases were reported from the states of Washington (602 cases/144 hospitalizations/3 deaths), Idaho (14 cases/4 hospitalizations/no deaths), California (34 cases/14 hospitalizations/1 death), and Nevada (58 cases/9 hospitalizations/no deaths). A case control study implicated the chain's hamburgers resulting in a multistate recall of the remaining hamburgers. Only 20 percent of the product remained at the time of the recall; this amounted to 272,672 hamburger patties. Subsequent testing of the hamburger patties showed the presence of E. coli O157:H7. The strain of E. coli O157:H7 found in ill people matched the strain isolated from uncooked hamburger patties. The outbreak illustrated the potential for large, foodborne illness outbreaks associated with restaurant chains receiving shipments of contaminated food. At the time, many clinical laboratories in the United States were not routinely culturing patients' stool for E. coli O157:H7 by using the correct culture medium. Additionally, many local and state health departments were not actively tracking and investigating E. coli O157:H7 cases. Chi Chi's Green Onion Hepatitis A Outbreak - 2003  565 ill, 130 hospitalized and 3 dead Pennsylvania State health officials first learned of a hepatitis A outbreak when unusually high numbers of hepatitis A cases were reported in late October 2003. All but one of the initial cases had eaten at the Chi Chi's restaurant at the Beaver Valley Mall, in Monaca, PA. Ultimately, at least 565 cases were confirmed. The victims included at least 13 employees of the Chi Chi's restaurant, and residents of six other states. Three people died as a consequence of their hepatitis A illnesses. More than 9,000 people who had eaten at the restaurant, or who had been exposed to ill people, were given a post-exposure injection as a prevention against developing hepatitis A. Preliminary analysis of a case-control study indicated fresh, green onions were the probable source of this outbreak. The investigation and tracebacks by the state health department, the CDC, and the FDA, confirmed that the green onions had been grown in Mexico. Dole Baby Spinach E. coli Outbreak - 2006  238 ill, 103 hospitalized and 5 dead On Sept. 13, 2006, public health officials in Wisconsin, Oregon and New Mexico noted E. coli O157:H7 infections with matching pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. These illnesses were associated with eating fresh, bagged spinach produced by Dole Brand Natural Selection Foods. By Sept. 26 that year, infections involving the same strain of E. coli O157:H7 had been reported from 26 states with one case in Canada. A voluntary recall was issued by the company on Sept. 15. E. coli O157: H7 was isolated from 13 packages of spinach supplied by patients in 10 states. Eleven of the packages had lot codes consistent with a single manufacturing facility on a particular day. The PFGE pattern of all tested packages matched the PFGE pattern of the outbreak strain. The spinach had been grown in three California counties - Monterey, San Benito and Santa Clara. E. coli O157:H7 was found in environmental samples collected near each of the four fields that provided spinach for the product, as designated by the lot code. However, E. coli O157:H7 isolates associated with only one of the four fields, located on the Paicines Ranch in San Benito County, had a PFGE pattern indistinguishable from the outbreak strain. The PFGE pattern was identified in river water, cattle feces and wild pig feces on the Paicines Ranch, the closest of which was less than one mile from the spinach field. Peanut Corporation of America Salmonella Outbreak - 2008 - 2009  714 ill, 171 hospitalized and 9 dead Beginning in November 2008, CDC's PulseNet staff noted a small and highly dispersed, multistate cluster of Salmonella Typhimurium isolates. The outbreak consisted of two pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) defined clusters of illness. Illnesses continued to be revealed through April 2009, when the last CDC report on the outbreak was published. Peanut butter and products containing peanut butted produced at the Peanut Corporation of America plant in Blakely, GA, were implicated. King Nut brand peanut butter was sold to institutional settings. Peanut paste was sold to many food companies for use as an ingredient. Implicated peanut products were sold widely throughout the USA, 23 countries and non-U.S. territories. Criminal sanctions were brought against the owners of PCA. Jensen Farms Cantaloupe Listeria Outbreak - 2011  147 ill, 143 hospitalized and 33 dead A multistate outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes involving five distinct strains was associated with consumption of cantaloupe grown at Jensen Farms' production fields near Granada, CO. A total of 147 ill people were reported to the CDC. Thirty-three people died, and one pregnant woman miscarried. Seven of the illnesses were related to pregnancy - three newborns and four pregnant women. Among 145 ill people with available information, 143 - 99 percent - were hospitalized. Source tracing of the cantaloupes indicated that they came from Jensen Farms, and were marketed as being from the Rocky Ford region. The cantaloupes were shipped from July 29 through Sept. 10, 2011, to at least 24 states, and possibly distributed elsewhere. Laboratory testing by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment identified Listeria monocytogenes bacteria on cantaloupes collected from grocery stores and from ill persons' homes.

Six cases have been hospitalized; five cases have been discharged and have recovered or are recovering. The status of one case was not provided to the agency. No deaths have been reported. The investigation is ongoing, but currently, 37 of 39 cases who have been interviewed have reported consumption of sprouted chia seeds or sprouted chia seed powder. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that, as of June 9, 2014, a total of 21 ill persons infected with the outbreak strains of Salmonella Newport (13 persons), Salmonella Hartford (6 persons), or Salmonella Oranienburg (2 persons) have been reported from 12 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Arizona (1), California (3), Colorado (1), Connecticut (3), Florida (1), Massachusetts (1), Michigan (1), New York (4), Ohio (1), Utah (1), Washington (1), and Wisconsin (3).  Two ill persons infected with a strain of Salmonella Oranienburg have been identified in two U.S. states.

Like the 188 six-packs recalled in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast on April 25th, there is a possibility that some of these yogurts may be contaminated with the coliform Klebsiella pneumoniae. These bacteria are often found in healthy people and often don't cause illness if they contaminate food and are eaten - but sometimes they do, although it's not completely clear how or why. Whether or not they cause illness may depend on the people who eat them - their health, their own genetic make-up, and/or how much of the bacteria they eat. The illness these bacteria are thought to sometimes cause if they contaminate food is gastroenteritis - watery diarrhea and other symptoms that may include nausea, vomiting, cramps, pain, fever, and chills. The majority of the recalled product was pulled from store shelves, but there is a possibility that a small number were purchased. Consumers who purchased the potentially affected YoBaby yogurt cups are asked to return opened and unopened containers to their retailers to be reimbursed for the full value of the purchase.

No further details were released on the patient. Another person has died in an outbreak of hepatitis A among patrons of a chain of restaurants in the Roanoke, VA, area. State officials confirmed the death today but declined to release the name or other details to protect the privacy of the victim and her family. The adult woman is the second person to die in the outbreak. The outbreak has sickened 49 people, with another person infected by contact with one of the direct outbreak patients. An unusually high number of the patients have been hospitalized, with 31 having been admitted. Health officials have said some of the patients have been discharged. ""A small number of cases are still under investigation. No new cases have been reported to RCAHD  (Roanoke City and Alleghany Health Districts ) this week,"" according to a statement released today. ""It is devastating that we have seen a high rate of severe disease associated with this outbreak."" All of the sick people, except the secondary patient, ate at one of three locations of Famous Anthony's restaurants at 4913 Grandin Road, 6499 Williamson Road, or 2221 Crystal Spring Ave.  An employee who worked at all three restaurants from Aug. 10 through 27 has tested positive for the virus, which causes an infection that attacks the liver. One of the victims has received a liver transplant. The cousin of the transplant patient reports the operation took place the weekend of Oct. 16-17. The patient's husband and daughter were also infected, according to the cousin. Christie Wills of the Roanoke City and Alleghany Health Districts says there is likely no ongoing threat to public health because the incubation time of the virus has expired. Generally, it can take up to 50 days for symptoms to manifest. Additional patients could be identified if there are sick people who have mild symptoms that become more severe and they seek medical attention. Health care providers in the area are on alert to watch for people with symptoms. Symptoms can include jaundice: yellowing of the skin or the eyes, fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine and light-colored stools, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A person can be contagious for up to two weeks before exhibiting symptoms, therefore the infected restaurant employee could have been infecting customers unknowingly. The virus is preventable with vaccination. Patients in the outbreak had tended to be older people, but as of an Oct. 21 statement from the health department, the patients had been trending toward younger people with the age range 31 to 79 years old at that time. The first patient who died, James Hamlin, and his wife Victoria frequently ate at one of the implicated Famous Anthony's restaurants, according to the local media. He died on Oct. 8 at age 75. He was a veteran of the Vietnam War. ""His daughter, Dana Heston of Cave Spring, said Hamlin was a strong and healthy man. He worked out three times per week -- lifting weights, riding a stationary bike and walking. He did not have any serious medical conditions,"" according to the Roanoke Times. Victoria Hamlin was also infected but is recovering. The health department offered a vaccination clinic for other employees at the Famous Anthony's restaurants.

The victims were reported from five states - North Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, Illinois and Georgia. Illnesses started on dates ranging from Nov. 5 to Nov. 16, 2019. Ill people ranged in age from 21 to 91, with a median age of 33. Among ill people, 60 percent were female. Four of the 10 ill people were hospitalized, including one person who developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure. No deaths were reported. In the same outbreak, Canadian officials are reporting that as of Dec. 18, 2019, there were 25 confirmed cases of E. coli O157 illness in the following provinces: Manitoba (1), Ontario (11), Quebec (3), New Brunswick (4), Nova Scotia (4), Prince Edward Island (1), and Newfoundland and Labrador (1). Individuals became sick between Nov. 5 and Nov. 23, 2019. Seven individuals have been hospitalized, including one person who developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure. No deaths have been reported. Individuals who became ill are between 3 and 73 years of age. The majority of cases, 68 percent, have been female. Information collected during the investigation indicated that Fresh Express Sunflower Crisp chopped salad kits were the likely source of this outbreak. Romaine lettuce was one of the ingredients in the salad kit, but the investigation was not able to determine if romaine lettuce was the contaminated ingredient in the salad kits. According to the FDA, This outbreak, a Washington state outbreak potentially linked to leafy greens, and a larger multi-state outbreak linked to romaine lettuce from the Salinas, CA growing region with cases in the U.S. and Canada, all shared a common romaine lettuce supplier with ranches in Salinas, CA. Although this grower was determined to be a common supplier for all three outbreaks based on available supply chain information, the romaine lettuce from this grower does not explain all the illnesses seen in the three outbreaks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Here are the details from the final outbreak report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:  October 22, 2020 reportThe first report on the outbreak said a total of 10 people were infected with the same strain of Listeria monocytogenes and were from three states. A list of those original states and the number of cases in each can be found on the Map of Reported Cases page. At that time the agency reported Listeria samples from ill people were collected from Aug. 6, 2020, to Oct. 3, 2020. Ill people ranged in age from 40 to 89 years, with a median age of 81 years. Eighty percent of ill people were female. All 10 ill people were hospitalized as of Oct. 22. State and local public health officials interviewed ill people about the foods they ate in the month before they became ill. Of the nine people interviewed, all reported eating Italian-style deli meats, such as salami, mortadella, and prosciutto. They reported purchasing prepackaged deli meats and meats sliced at deli counters at various locations. Listeria bacteria can spread easily to other foods and surfaces. The bacteria in a contaminated deli product may spread to other deli meats and cheeses in shared display cases or equipment at deli counters.  A traceback investigation is ongoing to determine if there is a specific type of deli meat or a common supplier linked to illness. People who are higher risk of getting sick from Listeria were advised to avoid eating deli meats unless they are heated to an internal temperature of 165degF or until steaming hot just before serving. December 4, 2020 report Since the last update on October 23, 2020, one ill person was added to the investigation. Epidemiologic evidence continued to show that deli meat is a likely source of this outbreak.

She liked shoes, especially designer brands like Michael Kors. ""She was the life of the party,"" Matlhogonolo said, Nthabiseng's 26-year-old sister.  Nthabiseng was a person who loved family above all else. She always wanted to have kids and was blessed with a daughter, Onthathile, who turns 5 this month. Matlhogonolo Chantell and her twin sister Michell Masego Zaza are raising their sister's daughter.  Onthathile doesn't remember much of her mother, who at the age of 35 died from listeriosis in Oct. 2018. Her death was part of a Listeria outbreak in South Africa that was traced to Tiger Brand's polony -- processed deli meat similar to baloney. However, it wasn't until 2020 that the family found out what had caused their Nthabiseng's mysterious illness. They knew only that many people in the country were getting sick. The listeriosis outbreak began at the start of 2017 and was officially declared over in September 2018 with 1,065 confirmed cases and 218 deaths.   In 2018, Nthabiseng was a new mom trying to adjust to the loss of her mother. Her partner, Onthathile's father, had passed away before he and Nthabiseng could be married. In the two years after his death, she would lose both of her parents.  Nthabiseng had already defied odds in having Onthathile. After a liver transplant in 2009, and constant medication in the aftermath, Nthabiseng was told she had only a small chance of being able to have a baby.  She was in and out of the hospital after her transplant, constantly having her liver checked to make sure it was still functioning properly. Her sister said the family had developed a system and routine to make sure Nthabiseng stayed healthy.  ""At a certain time, she takes her meds. She exercises and drinks water. We take a walk in the park. And we pray a lot,"" Matlhogonolo said. Nthabiseng and her family lived in a suburb of Johannesburg,  South Africa, where a trip to the hospital could take as long as three hours depending on the traffic. When Nthabiseng began to get sick, those hospital trips became more frequent.   Nthabiseng's battle with listeria poisoning  ""It was very quick,"" Matlhogonolo said. At first the sisters tried to nurse her at home. ""Trying to nurse this thing, it was out of control and they could not keep her fever down. And they were referring to her saying that her kidney and liver had become poison in the system. We thought maybe the liver was rejected by her system."" ""She would vomit a lot and she couldn't keep food down. She lost so much weight. Her eyes were yellow. Her eyes were turning yellow, so we knew something was wrong and something was eating her,"" Matlhogonolo said. ""She had diarrhea, that wouldn't stop. It was crazy. She lost so much weight because she was dehydrated."" The sisters thought that maybe it was tuberculosis or asthma. But they quickly realized this illness was different. ""She was not herself. She really changed. She also had these night sweats, like these cold sweats, and we couldn't understand. And it just kept going on and going on.""  Nthabiseng was placed into a high care intensive care unit. Nthabiseng's family knew that others in the country were getting sick with something similar, but nobody could tell them what was going on. ""The hospital and everything and nobody really knew what was making us sick,"" Matlhogonolo said. ""And we really didn't understand.""  Nthabiseng died Oct. 16, 2018, one month after the outbreak had been declared over. It took until 2020 for a law firm in South Africa to connect the dots and tell Matlhogonolo and her sister what happened to Nthabiseng and that it was connected to the Tiger Brands outbreak. ""We found it out this last year what really happened. What really caused it."" ""They found our names in the files and that we could be compensated if we pursued them. I mean we didn't know, because we were just trying to bury our sister and find our lives,"" Matlhogonolo said. The family in a matter of years had gone from six at home to three.  ""The year before both of our parents died and then our sister died, so a lot of things had happened. Our main focus was for us to like to find our feet. Try to find food. Try to make this baby go to kindergarten. My twin and I were like 24. It was too much to take in. So we just had to grow up.""  Life after Nthabiseng's passing Matlhogonolo wishes Tiger Brands officials had come forward as soon as the outbreak happened. She wishes the multinational company would compensate people and make the public aware that the outbreak was its fault. But she isn't angry at Tiger Brands. ""It's not good for us to hold onto rage or anger. We understand that things do go wrong in life. But I am disappointed that a big brand like them has never stepped out and looked for people that have had their lives damaged. A lot of people lost their loved ones.""  ""You can imagine as young as we were having no one to rely on, living in a society where they aren't supporting young black women is really hard. It is a struggle."" ""Knowing that Tiger Brands have done something like this, and they have never come out and said that they are sorry. And really show remorse and compensate. I am really disappointed in their brand. I would say I am disappointed, but I am just praying that justice is going to be served."" ""What I am crying for is her child. She deserves quality education. She deserves quality life. I am being like 26 there are still a lot of things that I need to do for myself and for if I grow old. And being a student like I am, they didn't think about how people like us really need to be taken care of.""  ""They should make amends for the mistakes.""

The California Department of Public Health reported Monday that four children who drank Organic Pastures whole, raw milk developed E. coli infections. At least two other children have identical strains of E. coli poisoning. A department spokesman Monday he could not release additional information because the investigation is ongoing into the outbreak and its link to Organic Pastures raw milk. The dairy recalled two lots of its whole, raw milk via its Facebook page at 9 p.m. Feb. 4. One lot had an expiration date of Jan. 23. The other expired Jan. 26. Organic Pastures also posted the recall on its website. ""Our food safety program saved the day,"" said dairy founder and CEO Mark McAfee when asked Monday about the CDPH report. ""It worked extremely well. We're proud of that."" McAfee said the test-and-hold procedure at the 500-cow dairy isn't a 100 percent guarantee that pathogens are not present in Organic Pastures raw milk products. Raw milk is not pasteurized, which kills harmful germs and bacteria including E. coli, Salmonella, Campylobacter and Listeria. McAfee's track record Previous recalls and foodborne illness outbreaks linked to Organic Pastures in the past decade include: October 2015 - Organic Pastures raw milk recall and quarantine after CDFA inspectors found Campylobacter as a result of product testing conducted as part of routine inspection and sample collection at the facility. September 2012 - Organic Pastures raw milk recall and quarantine after CDFA inspectors found Campylobacter bacteria as a result of product testing conducted as part of routine inspection and sample collection at the facility. January-April 2012 - Organic Pastures products linked to campylobacter outbreak. Raw milk, raw skim milk, raw cream and raw butter were recalled and the dairy quarantined after the confirmed detection of campylobacter bacteria in raw cream. State officials identified at least 10 people with campylobacter infections throughout California. They reported consuming Organic Pastures raw milk prior to illness onset. Their median age was 11.5 years, with six younger than 18. The age range was nine months to 38 years. August-October 2011 -- Organic Pastures products linked to E. coli outbreak. A cluster of five young children with E. coli O157:H7 infections with matching pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns was identified. Illness onsets were from Aug. 25 to Oct. 25. All five children reported drinking commercially available raw milk from a single dairy, Organic Pastures, and had no other common exposures. Investigations by the CDPH's Food and Drug Branch and the California Department of Food and Agriculture showed environmental samples collected at Organic Pastures yielded E. coli O157:H7 isolates that had PFGE patterns indistinguishable from the patient isolates. September 2008 -- Organic Pastures Grade A raw cream recall and quarantine after state testing and confirmation testing detected campylobacter bacteria in the cream. September 2007 -- Organic Pastures Grade A raw cream recall and quarantine following laboratory confirmation of the presence of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria. CDFA inspectors found the bacteria as a result of product testing conducted as part of routine inspection and sample collection at the facility. November-December 2007 --  Organic Pastures cows linked to Campylobacter outbreak. State officials found 50 strains of Campylobacter jejuni plus Campylobacter coli, Campylobacter fetus, Campylobacter hyointetinalis and Campylobacter lari when they cultured feces from Organic Pastures dairy cow feces. There was only one patient isolate available for DNA fingerprinting, but it was identical to isolates from four cattle fecal samples collected at Organic Pastures.

Four had culture-confirmed infections, one had a culture-confirmed infection and HUS (hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can result in kidney failure and stroke), and one had HUS only. The median age of patients was 8 years, with a range of 6 to 18 years. Organic Pastures' operators claimed the illnesses were linked to consumption of fresh spinach that was linked to a separate E. coli outbreak in 2006. However, the five children who consumed Organic Pastures' products who had culture confirmation were laboratory matches to each other and the CDC reported their specific E. coli isolates ""differed markedly from the patterns of the concurrent E. coli O157:H7 outbreak strain associated with spinach consumption.""

Mid-afternoon today a spokesperson for Philadelphia-based Soom Foods told Food Safety News that the company was not aware of the alert regarding its 1-ounce packets of Chocolate Sweet Tahini Halva Spread. She said company officials would check into the situation. The company has already recalled some of its tahini products in relation to a Salmonella Concord outbreak identified in late 2018. While the product sample behind today's public health alert is contaminated with Salmonella Tennessee, the Food and Drug Administration is concerned the product could infect people. There is also concern that consumers may have the product in their homes. The FDA found the Salmonella Tennessee in the tahini packets while investigating the Salmonella Concord outbreak.

""Retailers should not sell or give away this product and should discard it. ... ""Currently, the FDA is not aware of any illnesses related to consumption of these individually-packed halva spreads."" The FDA alert says consumers and retailers can identify the implicated tahini spread by looking for the following package details: Tahini products packed under five brands have been recalled in the U.S. because a sample tested positive for a strain of Salmonella Concord that had infected people. States with cases are Hawaii, Michigan, and New York. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advised consumers not to eat Achva, Achdut, Soom, S&amp;F, Pepperwood, and Baron's brand tahini.

""After further testing of an additional product lot from the suspected source of the recall, a single retail sample was found to be positive for Listeria monocytogenes,"" according to the Growers Express recall notice. The products originated from a Growers Express production facility in Biddeford, ME, and were distributed to Massachusetts and Maine. The same production plant prepared the long list of fresh vegetable products Growers Express recalled on July 1. That recall did not name the vegetable supplier. Neither dose the recall expansion. ""Growers Express is no longer sourcing vegetables from the suspected cause of the contamination,"" is the only reference to the supplier in the recall notice. There are no reported illnesses to date in relation to the products recalled by Growers Express. Consumers who purchased any of the recalled products from the affected ""best by"" or ""pack dates"" or with an unreadable date code are urged not to consume them and to throw the products away, the recall notice says. ""Please refer to the toll-free number listed on each package with any questions or requests for refund. Visit www.GrowersExpress.com/voluntaryrecall for the most up-to-date information."" About Listeria infectionsFood contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes may not look or smell spoiled but can still cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections. Anyone who has eaten any of the recalled product and developed symptoms of Listeria infection should seek medical treatment and tell their doctors about the possible Listeria exposure. Also, anyone who has eaten any of the recalled product should monitor themselves for symptoms during the coming weeks because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to Listeria for symptoms of listeriosis to develop.  Symptoms of Listeria infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache and neck stiffness. Specific laboratory tests are required to diagnose Listeria infections, which can mimic other illnesses.  Pregnant women, the elderly, young children, and people such as cancer patients who have weakened immune systems are particularly at risk of serious illnesses, life-threatening infections and other complications. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, their infections can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth.

Initially only one product was recalled, ""Smoked Lake Trout w/Pepper with Cracked Black Pepper."" One illness has been reported in connection with that product. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) reported the affected products were sold at Yummy Market stores in northern Toronto and Maple, Ontario. Several fish products are implicated, including the store's brand of smoked herring, lesch, mackerel, rainbow trout, salmon and sturgeon. The initial recall was issued last week after a consumer complaint and was expanded this week to include additional products based on information gathered during the CFIA investigation. The agency reported there have been no illnesses reported to the products listed in the expanded recall. The CFIA advises people to throw out the recalled products or return them to the store where they were purchased.

Caviar also recalled for botulism riskIn a separate notice, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency reports International House of Caviar is recalling its brand of rainbow trout caviar because of a risk of botulism. The company distributed the caviar in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and Saskatchewan. The recalled item is sold in 100-gram jars with a best before the date of Aug. 30, 2018. The CFIA reported there have been no reported illnesses linked to the caviar. Food contaminated with Clostridium botulinum toxin may not look or smell spoiled, but can still make you sick. It frequently paralyzes respiratory muscles, so timely medical attention is very important. Symptoms in adults can include facial paralysis or loss of facial expression, unreactive or fixed pupils, difficulty swallowing, drooping eyelids, blurred or double vision and difficulty speaking. Symptoms in children can include difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, generalized weakness and paralysis. (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

Skipanon Brand Seafoods LLC of Warrenton, OR, was issued a cease-and-desist order on Sept. 25, 2015, by the Oregon Department of Agriculture (ODA), and the department ordered a product embargo on Sept. 28, according to John Burr, an ODA food safety program manager in Salem, OR. Inside the Skipanon seafood cannery in Warrenton, OR. The regulatory actions were prompted by a cannery visit from ODA and inspectors with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the resulting recalls were due to potential contamination of the canned seafood products with Clostridium botulinum, whose toxin can cause foodborne botulism. ""FDA did the original inspections, and they were the ones who discovered the lack of documentation. I've not heard that they've actually found botulism anywhere. That doesn't minimize the seriousness of this because there is still a danger,"" said Bruce Pokarney, ODA's director of communications. Burr, who said he was recently down at the Skipanon cannery, had a similar view. ""No botulism has been detected at all. No spores were detected, no toxin detected. If that were the case, I think the investigation would have been very different,"" he said, adding, ""Low-acid canning is probably the most regulated industry and for very good reason."" A spokeswoman for FDA's San Francisco office would only confirm that the federal agency was involved and that the investigation is ongoing. ""We haven't come to any conclusions yet,"" she told Food Safety News. ""What is known is in the firm's press release. We haven't written the inspection report yet."" Processing fish in the Skipanon cannery. Mark Kujala, Skipanon's managing member, described the situation this way: ""There were some concerns about the process records that we had. Some, I guess, lack of documentation. When we started the recall effort, that was what they termed it as,"" he said. ""There were some issues updating our HACCP plans,"" Kujala continued. ""We had a process authority come down and review our process, and some of those things are being incorporated into our new process. We've had to file everything with the FDA."" Recall ripple effect On Oct. 9, 2015, Skipanon recalled all lots and all sizes of its own brand of canned seafood products (tuna, salmon, steelhead and sturgeon) because of the potential botulism risk. Subsequent secondary recalls of canned seafood products processed by Skipanon but bearing other brand labels include: Dungeness Seaworks, Sequim, WA; Brigham Fish Market, Cascade Locks, OR; Northwest Wild Products, Astoria, OR; Bornstein Seafood Inc. (including Krooke's, Logger's Choice, and Sharyn's brands), Astoria, OR; The Spot, Garibaldi, OR; Pacific Oyster Co. (Pacific Seafood brand), dba The Fish Peddler, Bay City, OR; Garibaldi Cannery LLC, Garibaldi, OR, Ecola Seafoods Inc., Cannon Beach, OR; Vis Seafoods Inc., Bellingham, WA; Josephson's Smokehouse of Astoria, OR; Gilmore Fish Smokehouse of Dallesport, WA; CSFPDX LLC of Garibaldi, OR; OleBob's Seafoods of Ilwaco, WA; Sockeye Suzy's Fish Co. of White Swan, WA, Farmer Creek of Cloverdale, OR, and Old Oregon Smokehouse of Rockaway, OR. Kujala explained that these are companies for which Skipanon does ""co-packing,"" meaning that these other firms bring the fish in and his company provides the canning services. ""We want to work with them so we can minimize the impact on their businesses,"" he said, adding, ""Certainly this is hard on us, but I definitely feel extremely terrible for the people that we've done work for who have been trying to do their own recalls."" He said Skipanon has made some operational changes and is working toward reopening the cannery before the end of this year. Skipanon canned salmon before lids and labels are put on. ""There were some things that we needed to correct, and we are doing that, and we are hoping to do processing again soon,"" Kujala said. Low-acid canning regulations The Oregon agriculture department's food safety program does not commonly take such strong enforcement actions regarding the businesses it regulates, Burr said. He noted that ODA's focus is on training issues, record-keeping and floor operations to keep food purveyors and processors in compliance with state requirements. ""They do have a HACCP plan,"" he said of Skipanon. ""HACCP is one facet of the seafood processing industry. If they're doing wholesale seafood products, however, a lot of the controls fall under the low-acid canning regulations."" Burr said that in the low-acid canning world and in some other types of industry, a processing authority helps provide the scientific basis for time, temperature, pressure and other considerations important in safe canning procedures. The processing authority might be an organization, an academic person, someone with industry experience, a researcher, or maybe an equipment manufacturer, he said. ""From when I went out there, they had already made great strides in correcting issues. And we instructed them to work with our process authority on issues such as filing all of their processes with the Food and Drug Administration,"" Burr said. ""We've asked them to update their seafood HACCP plan. We've talked to them about record-keeping requirements. We might have even encouraged them to consider taking some continuing education type stuff. We've asked them to track all the critical components, and we also asked them to validate the equipment and the processes -- the adequacy of all the processing equipment and the entire process,"" he added. Skipanon may not legally process any seafood products again until the cannery operation is in full compliance with state regulations, Burr noted. ""FDA gets a lot of their jurisdiction through interstate commerce, and it is very possible that [Skipanon] may be shipping in-state for a while,"" he said. ""They could ship in-state if they get an OK from us, but until the FDA inspection is done, they probably won't be shipping interstate."" State agriculture officials, along with those from FDA, are continuing to work with the cannery to make sure they know what is needed before getting a green light to restart operations. ""This is not a chess game, and there has got to be full openness here,"" Burr said. ""They know what they need to do, and I think there is a clear understanding what that expectation is. I think they have considered the benefits of everything we've told them."" Kujala said that the plan now is for Skipanon to be in a position to reopen in the very near future. ""We're hopeful, yes,"" he told Food Safety News. ""This is a huge impact to us, and we're just taking it day by day and trying to work with the Oregon Department of Ag and FDA to move forward on this."" What is botulism? According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), foodborne botulism is a rare but serious paralytic illness caused by eating foods containing a nerve toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. While botulism can be fatal, CDC states that, in the past 50 years, the proportion of people who die from it has fallen from 50 percent to about 3-5 percent today. Symptoms of botulism include double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, and muscle weakness. In foodborne botulism, symptoms generally begin 18 to 36 hours after eating a contaminated food, but they can occur as early as 6 hours or as late as 10 days, CDC states. ""Many cases of botulism are preventable. Foodborne botulism has often been from home-canned foods with low acid content, such as asparagus, green beans, beets and corn and is caused by failure to follow proper canning methods,"" CDC adds.

The outbreak, traced to frozen scallops imported from the Philippines and served raw at Genki Sushi restaurants on Oahu and Kauai, has sickened 284 adults. Onset dates of their illnesses range from June 12 through Sept. 16. As of Wednesday's weekly update from the Hawaii Department of Health, 71 of the victims have had symptoms so severe that they required hospitalization. Although the state health department identified the scallops as the likely source of the outbreak on Aug. 15, closing the implicated Genki Sushi restaurants and embargoing the scallops, it is likely that new outbreak victims will continue to be identified. Unvaccinated people can contract Hepatitis A from ""contact"" with infected people. Contact activities are detailed on the Hawaii health department web page dedicated to the outbreak updates. Another transmission route can be infected foodservice workers who can be contagious well before they begin to develop symptoms. State and federal health officials consistently report it can take up to 50 days after exposure for Hepatitis A symptoms to develop. As of Wednesday, Hawaii health officials had not reported any cases in the ongoing outbreak being transmitted via foodservice workers. However, the state is maintaining a rolling list of restaurants and other foodservice settings -- such as commercial airlines -- that have had one or more employees confirmed as outbreak victims. ""This list does not indicate these businesses are sources of this outbreak; at this time, no infections have been linked to exposure to these businesses. The likelihood that patrons of these businesses will become infected is very low,"" according to the Hawaii health department website. ""However, persons who have consumed food or drink products from these businesses during the identified dates of service should contact their healthcare provider for advice and possible preventive care. Listed businesses will be removed from this list once 50 days have elapsed from the affected employee's last service date while potentially infectious."" To help contain the outbreak, health officials say people who have been in contact with outbreak victims or dined at one of the restaurants on the list during exposure periods should monitor themselves for symptoms of infection. What to watch for and what to do The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports some people -- especially children -- who are infected with Hepatitis A do not have any symptoms. If symptoms occur, they usually appear two to six weeks after exposure. Symptoms usually develop over a period of several days. If you do have symptoms, they may include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, clay-colored bowel movements, joint pain, and a yellowing of the skin or eyes referred to as jaundice. Symptoms usually last less than two months, although some people can be ill for as long as six months. Almost all people who get Hepatitis A recover completely and do not have any lasting liver damage, although they may feel sick for months. Hepatitis A can sometimes cause liver failure and death, although this is rare and occurs more commonly in persons 50 years of age or older and persons with other liver diseases, such as Hepatitis B or C. If you have had contact with an outbreak victim or consumed food or any beverages at one of the restaurants where an employee has been confirmed as a victim, consult a doctor immediately and specifically mention your possible exposure to Hepatitis A. Public health officials are requesting that health care providers consider the outbreak when seeing patients with Hepatitis A symptoms and conduct appropriate tests. People exposed to the virus who have not been vaccinated can receive a post-exposure shot that is effective at avoiding infection development. However, the shot must be administer within two weeks of exposure. Information and resources from Hawaii health officials   (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

Health officials said that the outbreak also contributed to the death of one immunocompromised man. Twenty percent of cases were hospitalized. The farm linked to the outbreak, Ropelato Dairy in west Ogden, had its license reinstated on Oct. 3 after testing of samples showed no more sign of contamination, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. The state of Utah requires raw milk products to bear a label warning consumers of the potential illness risk, but Ropelato's milk reportedly did not carry that label. The vast majority of patients were Utah residents, though at least one was from Idaho and one from California. Ages of patients ranged from 2 to 74 years old. Most illnesses developed between May 9 and July 21. State health officials suspended the dairy's license to sell milk on Aug. 4. During a legislative hearing on the outbreak, a number of Utah lawmakers reportedly said that they did not want this incident to lead to restrictions on raw milk sales in the state. State law allows raw milk dairies in Utah to sell products directly to consumers as long as they own the store selling the products. Retail sales at stores not owned by the dairy are not allowed. Raw milk in Utah is also subject to monthly testing for pathogens, and the animals must be tested every six months.

In August and September, 44 Danes became ill including 30 women and 14 men between 0 and 75 years old. Thirteen people were hospitalized. Those sickened mostly live in Hovedstaden. A case was defined as a patient with either a culture-positive sample for Shigella sonnei or people PCR-positive for the ipaH gene, which is a marker for all Shigella species and enteroinvasive E. coli, from August 2020 onwards. The Statens Serum Institut (SSI) investigated the outbreak with the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (Fodevarestyrelsen) and DTU Food Institute. Patient interviews and tracebackInquiries showed the majority of patients had eaten fresh mint bought at local greengrocers or bazaars in and around the Copenhagen area from mid to late August. Because of the herb's short shelf life, it is thought there is no longer any contaminated product on the market and no risk of more people being infected. Among the 36 interviewed patients, 24 had eaten fresh mint before disease onset. Of the 24 cases, 22 had bought it in a greengrocer or bazaar. It was not sold in retail chains. A total of 12 different places were mentioned, which indicated the source of infection was a locally traded food. Traceback was difficult as the mint sellers had several suppliers during the outbreak period and had bought different types of mint packed in a variety of ways. A lack of invoices for purchase of the mint also hampered the investigation. The duration of the outbreak indicated there was probably only one or a few contaminated batches. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration has seized mint lacking traceability details and has taken some test samples with results pending. Luise Muller, an epidemiologist at SSI, said the outbreak was an opportunity to remind consumers that fresh herbs must always be washed thoroughly before eating them. Infections not common in DenmarkSSI checked with European health agencies but no other countries have reported an increase in Shigella infections in the same time period. Infections with Shigella are not common in Denmark and are most often acquired in connection with travel abroad. Interviews with those affected showed they had not been traveling before they became ill. Previous outbreaks in Denmark include one in 2007, when more than 210 people became ill from eating contaminated imported baby corn. Another outbreak in 2009 involved 10 people and was traced to fresh, raw sugar peas (sugar snaps) imported from Kenya. Most people infected with Shigella develop diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps starting a day or two after they are exposed to the bacteria. Shigellosis usually resolves in five to seven days but some people may experience symptoms from a few days to four or more weeks. People who are in poor health or who have weakened immune systems are more likely to get sick for a longer period of time. (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

About E. coli infections Anyone who has eaten any of the implicated products and developed symptoms of E. coli infection should seek medical attention and tell their doctor about their possible exposure to the bacteria. Specific tests are required to diagnose the infections, which can mimic other illnesses. The symptoms of E. coli infections vary for each person but often include severe stomach cramps and diarrhea, which is often bloody. Some patients may also have a fever. Most patients recover within five to seven days. Others can develop severe or life-threatening symptoms and complications, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). About 5 to 10 percent of those diagnosed with E. coli infections develop a potentially life-threatening kidney failure complication, known as a hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Symptoms of HUS include fever, abdominal pain, feeling very tired, decreased frequency of urination, small unexplained bruises or bleeding, and pallor. Many people with HUS recover within a few weeks, but some suffer permanent injuries or death. This condition can occur among people of any age but is most common in children younger than five years old because of their immature immune systems, older adults because of deteriorating immune systems, and people with compromised immune systems such as cancer patients. People who experience HUS symptoms should immediately seek emergency medical care. People with HUS will likely be hospitalized because the condition can cause other serious and ongoing problems such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, brain damage, and neurologic problems.

It can cause symptoms including general weakness, dizziness, double-vision, and trouble with speaking or swallowing. Difficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal distension and constipation may also occur. People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention.

The investigations are in a variety of stages. Some outbreaks have limited information with investigations ongoing, others may be near completion. The Food and Drug Administration will issue public health advisories for outbreak investigations that have resulted in specific, actionable steps for consumers -- such as throwing out or avoiding specific foods -- to take to protect themselves, according to the outbreak table page. Not all recalls and alerts result in an outbreak of foodborne illness. Outbreak investigations that do not result in specific, actionable steps for consumers may or may not conclusively identify a source or reveal any contributing factors, according to CORE's outbreak table page.

",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A1657,"Editor's note: Today Food Safety News takes a look back at the most significant recalls in the United States in 2018. As in past years, our year-end coverage is not merely a list of individual stories by individual writers. Generally, significant events are the other way around. Multiple stories by multiple writers are usually involved in our recall coverage, especially when illnesses or multiple companies are involved. It takes a newsroom -- not solo work -- to give readers the information they have come to expect from us. Some of the biggest food recall news of 2018 didn't come from a food producer or distributor. And, it didn't force consumers to check their cupboards or refrigerators for potentially poisonous food. It came from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb in September when he announced the agency would begin publicly disclosing retail locations that may have sold or distributed recalled food -- in some circumstances. The shift away from protecting ""confidential corporate information"" and toward public safety is so significant it made our Top 10 list of food safety news stories for 2018. Another headline out of the Food and Drug Administration's 2018 recall file was ""the agency's first-ever mandatory recall order,"" Gottlieb said in a Late November statement about the FDA's investigation of contamination of kratom products and dozens of related illnesses. The kratom situation, which included multiple recalls and a Salmonella outbreak, also earned a spot on the Food Safety News Top 10 list for the year. Other big recall news in the ""Year of the Dog"" involved millions of eggs, millions of pounds of meat and poultry, an unrevealed volume of other foods under the jurisdiction of FDA and the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). Here, in no particular order, are some of the most noteworthy recalls initiated in 2018. Romaine lettuceIt wasn't an official recall, but many growers and others in the romaine supply chain launched a voluntary ""market withdrawal"" of all forms and brands of the popular leafy green two days before Thanksgiving. The action was at the request of the FDA, which announced the third E. coli outbreak in 12 months on Nov. 20. Hundreds of people in the United States and Canada fell ill in the three outbreaks. At least five people died.   Outbreak investigators found the outbreak strain of E. coli O157: H7 involved in the fall outbreak in the sediment of an irrigation pond on Adam Brothers Farm in Santa Maria, CA. The romaine harvest was well over by December when the contamination was confirmed, but in mid-December, the family-owned farm recalled red and green leaf lettuces and cauliflower in relation to the contaminated pond. JBS beefIn October, JBS Tolleson Inc., a beef producer in Arizona that is part of the multi-national Brazilian company JBS S.A., recalled 6.5 million pounds of ground beef because of links to a Salmonella outbreak. The company expanded the recall in December to a total of more than 12 million pounds. As of Dec. 12, there were 333 people with confirmed Salmonella Newport infections across 28 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Jennie-O ground turkeyAlthough the CDC first announced a Salmonella outbreak traced to raw turkey in July, there weren't any related turkey recalls until Nov. 15 when Jennie-O Turkey Store Sales in Barron, WI, recalled more than 91,000 pounds of raw ground turkey products. On Dec. 21 a Jennie-O Store Sales location in Faribault, MN, recalled more than 164,000 pounds of raw ground turkey products. The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the CDC report the outbreak strain has been identified in samples taken from raw turkey pet food, raw turkey products, and live turkeys. A single, common supplier of raw turkey products or of live turkeys has not been identified that could account for the whole outbreak. As of Dec. 21, the CDC was reporting 216 people with confirmed Salmonella infections, including one death, across 38 states.  Shell eggsOn April 13, 2018, Rose Acre Farms of Seymour, IN, recalled more than 206 million shell eggs because they were implicated in a Salmonella outbreak bacteria. Three days later Cal-Maine Foods Inc. voluntarily recalled more than 280,000 eggs it had purchased from Rose Acre Farms. The CDC reported 45 people were infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella across 10 states. In September, Gravel Ridge Farms in Cullman County, AL, recalled eggs because of Salmonella. Forty-four people across 11 states were infected. The FDA put its new policy to work, listing some retailers that carried the Gravel Ridge Farms eggs.  McCain Foods USA Inc.At least a half-dozen companies recalled more than 755 tons of food products because they contained ingredients from a McCain Foods production facility in Colton, CA. The factory produces fire roasted caramelized or sauteed frozen fruit and vegetable products.  In a news release, McCain said it ""identified a potential health risk"" to its product line at Colton. The company was not exact about its problem at Colton when it originated, the volume of food involved, or where it was distributed. The products were sold in Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, Walmart, Kroger and Target stores across the country. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service reported more than a dozen food manufacturers in the U.S. received vegetables from McCain that were potentially contaminated with Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes bacteria. Fresh-cut melonWhen Walmart and Kroger pulled fresh-cut melon products from their shelves because they were implicated in a Salmonella outbreak, it took supplier Caito Foods 48 hours to initiate a recall of the fresh fruit. The volume of precut fruit products involved was not disclosed. Caito distributed the fresh-cut products, packaged with generic labels, to Costco, JayC, Kroger, Payless, Owen's, Sprouts, Trader Joe's, Walgreens, Walmart, and Whole Foods/Amazon. The CDC reported 77 people were confirmed ill in the related outbreak. Del Monte fresh vegetable traysAn outbreak of infections from the Cyclospora parasite spurred Del Monte Fresh Produce N.A. Inc. to recall vegetable trays containing fresh broccoli, cauliflower, celery sticks, carrots, and dill dip in mid-June. Neither the company nor the FDA reported how many pounds were recalled. Del Monte distributed the vegetable-dip trays to retailers including Kwik Trip, Kwik Star, Demond's, Sentry, Potash, Meehan's, Country Market, Food Max Supermarket and Peapod. The CDC reported 250 people in four states were confirmed with the parasitic infections. McDonald's saladsAlso because of Cyclospora parasite infections, McDonald's pulled an undisclosed number of salads from restaurants in 14 states in July. Ingredients for the salads were distributed by Caito Foods, but were produced by Fresh Express. Caito Foods officials told the FDA that Fresh Express had notified it of a product recall involving romaine that could be contaminated with the parasites. FDA issued a public alert after Cyclospora was confirmed in Fresh Express product, but the romaine-carrot mix was past its shelf life at that point. When the outbreak was declared over, there had been 511 people across 16 states confirmed with Cyclospora infections. Retailers including Trader Joe's, Kroger, and Walgreens removed salads and wraps from their shelves because of the situation. Honey SmacksIn June the Kellogg Co. issued an international recall of its Honey Smacks cereal in relation to a multistate Salmonella outbreak. The massive recall is still active. However, the CDC declared the outbreak over in late September when the confirmed patient count was 135. Public health officials are concerned that consumers could still have unopened boxes of the recalled cereal in their homes because of the product's long shelf life. All Honey Smacks cereal, regardless of size, with best-by dates through June 14, 2019, is subject to the recall.  Duncan Hines cake mixIn November Conagra Foods recalled four flavors of Duncan Hines brand cake mix after federal investigators told them Oregon's public health department found Salmonella in a box of Duncan Hines cake mix. The strain matched that of patients in a multistate Salmonella outbreak. A spokesperson with the Food and Drug Administration told Food Safety News the manufacturing plant where the recalled cake mix was produced is in the United States. The FDA's outbreak investigation announcement Nov. 5 reported the agency was inspecting the manufacturing plant, but did not indicate where the plant is located. Goldfish crackers, Hungry Man dinners, Ritz crackersSeveral varieties of ""the snack that smiles back"" were voluntarily recalled by Pepperidge Farm during the summer after the whey powder used in a seasoning ingredient was found to be contaminated with Salmonella. In addition to the Goldfish crackers from Pepperidge Farm, several other products had to be recalled, including Hungry Man frozen dinners, Ritz brand crackers in the U.S. and Canada, and several brands of snack cakes. Both the FDA and the FSIS reported the manufacturer of the whey powder was Associated Milk Producers Inc., but the company did not issue a public recall. Officials with Minnesota-based AMPI posted a news release in July saying none of the implicated whey powder was sold directly to consumers.

",McCain Foods USA Inc.,frozen fruit and vegetable products,potential health risk,N/A,N/A,"Colton, CA"4585,"Forty years worth of outbreak statistics can be summed up in a twisted version of the infamous Powerball slogan, but the researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention didn't come right out and say ""if you don't look, you can't see outbreaks."" The bottom line from the CDC's report ""Foodborne (1973-2013) and Waterborne (1971-2013) Disease Outbreaks -- United States"" is illustrated by the tall tale of Texas outbreaks. Doug Powell, publisher of barfblog.com, brought this to my attention in his post about the CDC's data, which includes a map of the U.S. showing how many outbreaks each state had in 2013 and corresponding per capita rates. The report on the ""most recent data available"" shows Texas with a low rate for outbreaks in 2013, as it has shown in previous years. ""To avoid foodborne illness, move to Texas. That hasn't changed since 1973,"" Powell quipped. Dramatic pause for emphasis here. ""All it means is, cowboys and girls don't look too hard. It's just a little barfing  --  get over it."" May I add, even cowgirls get the trots. All kidding aside, Doug's observation about the efforts, or lack thereof, of the guys and gals in Texas -- and other states, too, based on the color coded map from CDC -- is supported by the authors of the outbreak report. ""Reporting practices for foodborne and waterborne disease outbreaks vary among states and territories, which might have differing definitions or interpretations of which events are reportable and unique laws related to disease outbreak reporting,"" according to the Interpreting Data section of the report. ""Thus, variations in reporting rates by state or territory might reflect variations in levels of effort and funding for foodborne and waterborne disease outbreak investigation, rather than true differences in outbreak incidence rates by state."" Really? Seriously? Oh you wacky scientific types and your desire to compare apples to apples and your goofy government buddies who want to predict orange trends by using orange data. Don't you know E. coli acts differently in a person's gut in California than it does when that person's in Connecticut? It's as clear as state's rights, right? You might want to wipe the sarcasm off your screen now before the goop dries into a permanent smear. But before you do, consider this. In addition to having varying laws defining outbreaks and responses, states are on the honor system when it comes to reporting crucial public health data to the federal government. ""As for all notifiable conditions, reporting to CDC is voluntary, and state and local laws, regulations, and practices vary,"" the researchers reported. ""For example, CDC advises states to report outbreaks having cases occurring in the same household; however, state, local, or territorial jurisdictions might determine that these outbreaks do not require investigation or might deem them non-reportable at the state or territorial level."" That's right, first individual states get to decide how to look for -- or not look for --outbreaks. Then, in their infinite regional wisdom, they get to write their own definitions of what constitutes an outbreak. Finally, after they have or have not looked for, and found or not found an outbreak, it's up to states whether they report or don't report the public health data to the feds. So, at the risk of providing information that nay sayers may say is incomplete, and scientists have already said represents ""only a small fraction"" of actual outbreaks and illnesses, here are the highlights from 1973-2013. From 1973-2013, CDC received reports of 30,251 foodborne disease outbreaks with 742,945 outbreak-associated illnesses from the 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and freely associated states/territories. Why anyone needs to knowSometimes the numbers take so deep into the weeds you begin wondering how you'll find your way back to reality. The CDC report authors anticipated that trip and provided a bit of a map to Relevance City. ""... information gathered from foodborne disease outbreak surveillance activities provides valuable insights into the agents that cause foodborne illness, types of implicated foods and ingredients, and settings in which transmission occurs,"" according to the report. The report authors also said surveillance of foodborne disease outbreaks: Knowledge is power. Not a bad use of my tax dollars, IMHO.

Media reports quoted Iraqi Health Minister Adila Hamoud earlier this week as having said two deaths had been caused by the outbreak, but the World Health Organization reported the same day that it had not documented any deaths. The United Nations estimates 6,235 people live in the camp. ""Eight-hundred-and-twenty-five (825) cases have been reported, of these 638 were referred to various health facilities; 386 cases have been admitted to hospitals in Erbil,"" according to the WHO's Tuesday report on the situation at Hassan Sham U2 IDP camp, which is west of Erbil and about 13 miles east of Mosul. ""Currently no deaths have been documented. The affected communities are mainly internally displaced people from west Mosul, of whom a third of all the cases were children and two-thirds were female."" The WHO is assisting local and federal health officials with the investigation of the outbreak. Investigators from the WHO collected food samples and victims' stool samples for testing at the Central Public Health Laboratory in Erbil. People at the refugee camp began having symptoms of foodborne illness after a June 12 iftar, an evening meal that Muslims use to break their dawn-to-dusk fasting during their holy month of Ramadan. ""The majority of the cases predominately presented with vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea, consistent with foodborne illness,"" according to the WHO. ""All patients referred to health facilities have rapidly improved on supportive medical treatment."" Although the WHO did not speculate about how food served at the refugee camp might have become contaminated, at least one Iraqi official told the Associated Press it was an intentional, aggressive act. ""An Iraqi lawmaker who visited the camp and Saudi state television accused a charity from Qatar -- a small Gulf Arab country engulfed in a major diplomatic dispute with Saudi Arabia and several other Arab and Muslim nations -- of providing the tainted food,"" the AP reported. ""The claims could not be independently confirmed and Qatari officials did not immediately answer calls for comment."" The Iraqi health minister would not speculate on whether food could have been intentionally contaminated, according to the AP. Raad al-Dahlaki, chair of the Iraqi parliament's immigration and displacement committee, visited the camp and told the AP the suspect meal included rice, a bean sauce, meat, yogurt and water. Al-Dahlaki said the meals were distributed by a Qatari charity known as RAF, according to the AP. Although the WHO report did not mention where the suspect food came from, and did not suggest the contamination was intentional, the international health organization did include a reminder from the local health officials. ""In light of this event, Erbil Directorate of Health further reiterates its earlier instruction to all camp managers to avoid any distribution of hot meals to IDPs (Internally Displaced Persons)."" The refugees in the Hassan Sham U2 camp meet the definition of IDPs. Most of them fled their homes in and around Mosul beginning in October 2016 after a U.S.-backed Iraqi offensive was launched against the Islamic State group from the city. Organizations assisting the WHO with the outbreak are the International Medical Corps; ADRA; the International Organization for Migration; Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) and Barazani Charity Foundation.

FDA's Form 483, observations for the March 26 to April 11, 2018 inspection of Hyde County Egg at 1560 Hyde Park Canal Road in Pantego, NC, documents problems at the production facility for three million hens producing 2.3 million eggs per day. Rose Acre Farms, headquartered in Seymour, IN, announced a recall on April 13, 2018, of nearly 207 million shell eggs from the Hyde County Egg. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention went public with the Salmonella Braenderup outbreak on April 16. CDC's only update came three days later on April 19, with 23 confirmed cases in nine states. Hospital care for six was required. None died. FDA's inspection before the recall and outbreak shows problems continued to exist the Hyde County Egg even after cleaning procedures were carried out. Rodent activity and pests were a problem dating back to at least September 2017, according to records examined by FDA inspectors. In poultry houses 9 and 13, FDA found rodents in the manure pits. In one area spray foam created a ""potential pest entrance"" to the manure pits by going around a closed up door. FDA personnel observed both live and dead rodents in these areas. Poultry houses 2, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 11 were also sites for robust rodent activities, including on the hen house floors. ""There were unsanitary conditions and poor employee practices observed in the egg processing facility that create an environment that allows for the harborage, proliferation, and speed of filth and pathogens throughout the facility that could cause the combination of egg processing equipment and eggs,"" says the Form 483 report. FDA found that cleaning procedures ""were not being implemented by management and followed by sanitation employees,"" it said. Instead, the sanitation workers were skipping steps and not waiting for detergent to soak as required. ""Throughout the inspection we observed condensation dripping from the ceiling, pipes, and down walls, onto production equipment (i.e., crack detector, egg grader) and pooling on the floors in foot traffic and forklift pathway,"" the Form 483 report adds. FDA inspection personnel also found Hyde County Egg's conveyor belts, chains, rail guards, buffers, egg transport arms, egg clappers, production computers and production equipment surfaces were covered with 'accumulated food debris including dried eggs and shell. ""The same areas of accumulated food debris were observed uncleaned on multiple days during the inspection pre- and post sanitation,"" the reports says. A steel wool scrubber was removed by an employee from a dustpan of water and egg mix and used to scrub debris off the egg buffers. Finally, numerous flying insects were inside the egg processing facility. USDA inspectors are on duty to grade eggs produced by Hyde County, but generally, they do not stray far from the grading booth as they examine the day's production. Egg inspectors are the end of the production line, and not responsible for what goes on in the far-flung hen houses. Rose Acre's recall is the largest since 2010 when 550 million eggs were called back from two Iowa egg production facilities owned by one-time egg baron Austin ""Jack"" Decoster. ""Jack"" and Peter DeCoster and Quality Egg LLC paid a total of $7 million in fines, and the father and son each served three months jail for allowing their bad eggs to reach the market. Almost 2,000 people were sickened by the recalled DeCoster eggs. (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

Her comments have been added throughout below. Cookies sold at ShopRite stores are being recalled because they may contain small metal fragments. A recall alert -- dated Aug. 5 but not emailed until today by the Food and Drug Administration -- does not indicate whether the cookie recall is related to an ongoing recall by a sugar supplier that has spurred a number of secondary recalls. ShopRite spokeswoman Karen Meleta said the metal fragments were noticed by a store employee at one location and the recall was immediately issued for the cookies sold at all ShopRite stores. She said the cookies are baked at individual stores using premixed ingredients.

Cookies included in the recall can be identified by the following label information:   No injuries related to the recalled cookies had been reported as of Aug. 5, according to the recall notice. Details of the cookie recall are similar to those reported in July recall notices from ConAgra for almost 1,000 tons of P.F. Chang's frozen entrees and from Weis Markets for 30 bakery products. Both of those recalls cited metal fragments in sugar supplied by an unnamed company and used in the production of the frozen foods and fresh baked goods.

In the U.S., 25 people from nine states have been confirmed with infections from two outbreak strains of Salmonella. In Canada, one person has salmonellosis from a strain matching one of the outbreak strains identified by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Six of the U.S. victims had symptoms so severe that they required hospitalization. Evershing International Trading Co. recalled all Coconut Tree brand frozen shredded coconut packaged in 16-ounce plastic bags on Jan. 3, but the product's long shelf life prompted a warning from the CDC on Tuesday. ""The frozen shredded coconut linked to this outbreak was used as an ingredient in Asian-style dessert drinks served at restaurants. The product was also sold in grocery stores and markets in several states,"" according to the CDC in its initial outbreak notice. ""Frozen shredded coconut can last for several months if kept frozen and may still be in retail stores or in people's homes. CDC recommends that retailers not sell, restaurants not serve, and consumers not eat recalled Coconut Tree brand frozen shredded coconut."" The outbreak, which began in May 2017, could be ongoing. As of Jan. 12, the CDC had confirmed outbreak cases in nine states. The most recent U.S. victim's symptoms began on Nov. 4. The confirmed outbreak serotypes are Salmonella I 4,[5],12:b:- and Salmonella Newport. However, additional product testing since the first of the year by Massachusetts public health officials has identified ""several"" other strains of Salmonella in packages of Coconut Tree brand frozen shredded coconut. ""Laboratory testing of other several types of Salmonella bacteria, including Salmonella Javiana, Salmonella Rissen, and Salmonella Thompson. These samples were from unopened packages of Coconut Tree Brand Frozen Shredded Coconut sold before Jan. 3,"" the CDC reported. ""CDC is reviewing the PulseNet database to determine if the other Salmonella isolates from the frozen shredded coconut are linked to any illnesses."" The Massachusetts Department of Public Health identified the outbreak in December 2017 while investigating a single case of Salmonella infection. Investigators collected food items from a restaurant where that ill person had consumed Asian-style dessert drinks. Tests showed Salmonella in the coconut used in the drink. State and federal disease investigators have interviewed 16 of the outbreak patients. Of those, 10 reported eating or maybe eating coconut. Of those 10 people, 8 reported having an Asian-style dessert drink that contained frozen shredded coconut before becoming ill. In addition to linking coconut used in the dessert drink to the salmonellosis patient, the department's epidemiologists also identified a strain of Salmonella that is new to the CDC's PulseNet database. ""The fact that we have detected this strain of Salmonella that caught the attention of the U.S. government is a testament to the work of our dedicated staff, whom I applaud,"" said Massachusetts Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel in a news release. Advice to consumersThe CDC recommends that retailers not sell, restaurants not serve, and consumers not eat the Coconut Tree brand recalled frozen shredded coconut. ""If you have recalled frozen shredded coconut in your home, you can return it to the place of purchase for a refund,"" according to the CDC's outbreak consumer advice page. ""If you aren't sure if the frozen coconut you bought is Coconut Tree brand frozen shredded coconut, you can ask the place of purchase. Restaurants and retailers can ask their supplier. When in doubt, don't eat, sell, or serve it. Throw it out."" Consumers who have had the recalled coconut in their homes should wash and sanitize countertops as well as drawers or shelves in refrigerators or freezers where frozen shredded coconut was stored. Anyone who has eaten the recall coconut, or foods or beverages made with it, and developed symptoms of Salmonella infection should immediately seek medical attention and tell their doctors about the possible exposure to the pathogen. Most people infected with Salmonella develop symptoms within 12 to 72 hours after being exposed to the bacteria. Symptoms can include fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In severe cases, the infection can be fatal. Infants, young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with a weakened immune system are at greatest risk.

Toronto Public Health (TPH) is investigating the cases in people who ate at Druxy's in the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, the country's largest cancer care center. TPH is asking anyone who ate deli meats at the restaurant between Jan. 1 and March 12 to watch for signs and symptoms of Listeria infection and seek medical attention if they have any. ""All the patients were quite ill,"" Dr. Vinita Dubey, TPH associate medical officer of health, told the Toronto Sun. Listeria infection can make anyone sick, but it presents a greater danger to adults over 60, pregnant women, young children and people with weakened immune systems, which makes it a particular concern to cancer patients. Common symptoms include fever, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea and cramps. Severe symptoms include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions. The symptoms can develop suddenly in people who have weak immune systems because of medical treatment or illness. Symptoms usually occur within three weeks of eating foods contaminated with Listeria, but it can take up to 70 days in some people. There is no vaccine to prevent the Listeria infection, but it can be treated with antibiotics. Healthy people may only experience mild symptoms and usually recover completely. Individuals without symptoms do not need to be tested or treated. Listeria infection is a serious but rare illness caused by eating food contaminated with the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. Common foods contaminated with the bacteria include deli meats and unpasteurized, raw dairy products. Healthcare providers frequently overlook Listeria as a possible cause of illness because of its unusual growth capabilities. Laboratories sometimes have a difficult time culturing Listeria, and when they can, it can be confused with other, less harmful contaminants and disregarded. TPH staff have completed an extensive risk assessment, collected samples of the surfaces and food for testing and ordered a thorough cleaning of the restaurant and equipment inside the Princess Margaret Druxy's. The restaurant is closed at this time to prevent further risk to the public. Public health officials have issued an alert to Toronto hospitals, long-term care facilities and doctors' offices to make sure they are aware of the illnesses and possibility of additional patients with Listeria infections. About 2,500 illnesses and 500 deaths are attributed to listeriosis in the United States each year. Toronto generally has about 17 cases a year. Food-processing environment is vulnerable to Listeria monocytogenes from sources including infected employees, contaminated raw materials and failure to properly clean equipment and drains. Control is complicated by the bacterium's ability to survive and grow under conditions not generally tolerated by similar organisms -- it can survive at temperatures from below freezing to body temperature and grows best at the 0 degrees F to 50 degrees F range, which includes the temperature range used for freezing and refrigeration.

Genki Sushi restaurants feature a conveyor belt delivery system for food, sending plates of raw seafood winding through tables and patrons. State and federal authorities identified the source of the infections to be frozen scallops from the Philippines that were served raw by Genki Sushi fast food restaurant locations on Oahu and Kauai. State officials ordered the restaurants to close on Aug. 15 and embargoed the scallops. ""Although the 50-day maximum incubation period from the date of the scallops' embargo has passed, HDOH continues to be alert for people who have had onset of illness earlier but may present late to a clinician, as well as possible secondary cases. Secondary cases have been rare in this outbreak and have been limited to household members of cases or close contacts of cases,"" according to the Wednesday update. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration are involved in the outbreak investigation, the federal agencies have not posted updates since Aug. 19 and 24, respectively. What to watch for and what to do The CDC reports some people -- especially children -- who are infected with Hepatitis A do not have any symptoms. If symptoms occur, they usually appear two to six weeks after exposure. Symptoms usually develop over a period of several days. If you do have symptoms, they may include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, clay-colored bowel movements, joint pain, and a yellowing of the skin or eyes referred to as jaundice. Symptoms usually last less than two months, although some people can be ill for as long as six months. Almost all people who get Hepatitis A recover completely and do not have any lasting liver damage, although they may feel sick for months. Hepatitis A can sometimes cause liver failure and death, although this is rare and occurs more commonly in persons 50 years of age or older and persons with other liver diseases, such as Hepatitis B or C. If you have had contact with an outbreak victim or consumed food or any beverages at one of the restaurants where an employee has been confirmed as a victim, consult a doctor immediately and specifically mention your possible exposure to Hepatitis A. Public health officials are requesting that health care providers consider the outbreak when seeing patients with Hepatitis A symptoms and conduct appropriate tests. People exposed to the virus who have not been vaccinated can receive a post-exposure shot that is effective at avoiding infection development. However, the shot must be administer within two weeks of exposure. Information and resources from Hawaii health officials   (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

Coli outbreak that has now sickened at least 16 people. At least a dozen of the patients have been so sick that they have been admitted to hospitals, according to a statement from the Jackson County Public Health Department. Reports of the illnesses began on Aug. 8. Officials say they have not yet identified a source of the infections and they do not have any theories on what it might be.  The age range for the patients is from 11 months to 65 years of age, with the median age being 23.5. The majority of the cases are in the teens and 20s, according to a county spokeswoman. Of the total cases, 62.5 percent are males. She did not report when the most recent illness began. The Oregon Health Authority is assisting with the investigation but the county spokeswoman said the county remains the point agency in the investigation. The county officials say the number of patients is ""unusually high."" ""Right now, we do not have a definitive hypothesis on what the source of infection may be. The genome sequencing, performed at the state public health lab, has not matched any other cases in the state or nationally,"" Jim Shames, Health Officer for Jackson County Public Health, said in the department's statement.  ""Therefore, we continue to do in-depth interviews with those that have tested positive to help us identify a possible source of exposure."" This past week Shames told local media that ""a couple of children"" were at OHSU ""receiving emergency treatment."" In an effort to identify other possible outbreak patients the county officials are asking area doctors and other health care providers to be on the lookout for signs of E. Coli infections and conduct appropriate testing. About E. coli infectionsAnyone who has developed symptoms of E. coli infection should seek medical attention and tell their doctor about their possible exposure to the bacteria. Specific tests are required to diagnose the infections, which can mimic other illnesses, according to the federal CDC. The symptoms of E. coli infections vary for each person but often include severe stomach cramps and diarrhea, which is often bloody. Some patients may also have a fever. Most patients recover within five to seven days. Others can develop severe or life-threatening symptoms and complications, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). About 5 to 10 percent of those diagnosed with E. coli infections develop a potentially life-threatening kidney failure complication, known as a hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Symptoms of HUS include fever, abdominal pain, feeling very tired, decreased frequency of urination, small unexplained bruises or bleeding, and pallor. Many people with HUS recover within a few weeks, but some suffer permanent injuries or death. This condition can occur among people of any age but is most common in children younger than five years old because of their immature immune systems, older adults because of deteriorating immune systems, and people with compromised immune systems such as cancer patients. People who experience HUS symptoms should immediately seek emergency medical care. People with HUS will likely be hospitalized because the condition can cause other serious and ongoing problems such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, brain damage, and neurologic problems.

It is one of five producers bottling raw milk in California. California's State Veterinarian, Dr. Annette Jones, issued the quarantine order after the confirmed detection of the bacteria Campylobacter jejuni in the farm's packaged raw whole milk sampled and tested by the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA). The raw milk is sold in one-gallon plastic jugs and consumers are strongly urged to dispose of any product remaining in their refrigerators that were purchased or received on 3/11/19 through 3/19/19. CDFA found the campylobacter bacteria in a routine sample collected at the Valley Milk Simply Bottled production and packaging facility. No illnesses have been reported. Symptoms of campylobacteriosis include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever. Most people with campylobacteriosis recover completely. The illness usually occurs 2 to 5 days after exposure to Campylobacter and lasts about a week. The illness is usually mild and some people with campylobacteriosis have no symptoms at all. However, in some persons with compromised immune systems, it can cause a serious, life-threatening infection. A small percentage of people may have joint pain and swelling after infection. In addition, a rare disease called Guillain-Barre syndrome that causes weakness and paralysis can occur several weeks after the initial illness. Neither CDFA or Valley Milk have provided any updates since the recall and quarantine were announced on March 20. Food Safety News invited Valley Milk to comment without a response. California permits retail sale of raw milk produced by dairy farms that meet CDFA's health and sanitary requirments. Raw milk dairy farms must obtain a Market Milk Permit. Cows or goats, producing raw milk, must be tested and found non-reactive to annual tuberculin and brucellosis testing. California's Milk and Dairy Food Safety Branch (MDFS) inspect dairy farms and bottling plants, collecting milk samples for laboratory testing. Dairy employees and facilities must meet sanitary standards and raw milk at the time of delivery must meet specific bacterial levels to be deemed safe.

The infections are linked to eating a brand of raw milk goat cheese in Ain, in the Rhone-Alpes region, between April and May this year, according to Sante publique France. The cheese producer is GAEC des Chevrettes du Vieux Valey, based at Condamine in Haut-Bugey, Ain. It is thought ticks carrying the virus contaminated a goat, then its milk, then the cheeses, and finally consumers. A total of 42 cases of lymphocytic meningitis, encephalitis and infectious syndromes have been identified in people living in the commune of Oyonnax, within a radius of 30 kilometres. Two additional people live in Loire-Atlantique and Jura but consumed the implicated raw milk goat's cheese. Cases occurred between the week of April 13 to 19 and May 18 to 24 with a peak from April 20 to 26. Virus found in cheeseAt the end of May, the diagnosis of tick-borne Encephalitis (TBE) virus, the agent responsible for tick-borne encephalitis, was confirmed for 33 of the 44 cases. The other 11 are under investigation and biological tests are being done to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of tick-borne encephalitis. Among confirmed cases, the median age is 49 with the youngest patient aged 11 months and the oldest 86 years old. Thirty people were hospitalized or went to hospital and two have been admitted to intensive care. Forty-one of 43 cases reported having raw milk cheese from the same producer in Ain from mid-April. Presence of the TBE virus has been identified in a goat cheese from the company. A recall of dairy products from the firm was carried out before this result was known. The producer has started pasteurizing goat milk before processing. A withdrawal and recall of products on sale at the time of the alert was conducted in late May. A statement from GAEC des Chevrettes du Vieux Valey said the TBE virus carried by ticks was found on a single batch of cheeses produced on April 20 with checks on more recent products negative but it continues to discard product from milking until authorities say it can restart sales. ""We are awaiting the results of the blood tests on our goats to ensure that our animals are no longer carriers of this virus. We also wish a speedy recovery to the victims of this virus and we will inform you of the progress of the investigation concerning us,"" according to a statement from the farm owners. Rare infections from food sourceOccurrence of sporadic cases of tick-borne encephalitis is not new in the Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes region with a few identified each year. One case was identified at the end of May 2020 in Ain in a person bitten several times by ticks but who did not consume the cheese. Most infections with the virus result from infected ticks, which often remain attached to the skin for days. On rare occasions, infection can result from consumption of unpasteurized milk from infected goats, sheep or cows, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The incubation period of TBE is usually between 7 and 14 days. In an early phase, symptoms may include fever, malaise, anorexia, muscle aches, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting. After an asymptomatic interval, a second phase of disease occurs in some patients who could experience symptoms of meningitis such as fever, headache, and a stiff neck and encephalitis (e.g., drowsiness, confusion, sensory disturbances, and/or motor abnormalities such as paralysis). Encephalitis developing during this second phase may result in paralysis, permanent health issues or death. Severity of illness increases with age of the patient and there is no specific treatment for tick-borne encephalitis, according to the WHO. The French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety (ANSES) is doing additional environmental studies on ticks and the TBE virus in the geographic area concerned. Investigations are also being carried out, particularly among dairy farmers, because ticks carrying this virus may be present in other municipalities.

Ventura County Public Health staff is working with the county's Environmental Health department, which completed two inspections of the restaurant ""in the past two days,"" according to the Friday news release from the county. ""We're tracking these cases closely,"" said Public Health Officer Robert Levin in the county release. Levin praised the Souplantation corporate office for closing the restaurant location through this weekend. Three Souplantation executives traveled to the Camarillo restaurant in response to the outbreak, the chief operating officer a vice president and the company's quality assurance manager, according to the county release.

Anyone who has eaten at the Souplantation in Camarillo recently and developed symptoms of shigellosis should seek medical attention and tell their doctors about the possible exposure. Shigellosis is highly contagious, but some people who are infected do not have any symptoms. Such individuals can pass the bacteria to others. Most people who are infected with Shigella develop diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps starting a day or two after they are exposed to the bacteria. Shigellosis usually resolves in five to seven days.

This latest action to strengthen food safety practices that will be required by romaine lettuce farms came Friday in a vote by the California Leafy Greens Marketing Agreement Board of Directors. California and Arizona's Yuma Growing Region together account for 90 percent of the leafy greens grown the United States. Growers in both states signed on to Leafy Green Marketing Agreements after the deadly 2006 E. coli outbreak associated with freshly bagged spinach to overcome doubts that major retail buyers were expressing about the industry at that time. Last year, those doubts returned with back-to-back-to-back E. coli O157:H7 outbreaks that were linked to eating romaine lettuce grown in the Yuma region and in California. Those three outbreaks were also deadly events, killing six people out of the 297 confirmed E. coli cases that resulted from the outbreaks that began in the final days of 2017 and continued into early 2019. Both LGMAs previously adopted new standards for their growers that were announced in January. Those involved equipment cleaning practices, proactive steps for flooding and high wind weather-related events, mandatory traceability measures, and buffers between growing areas and feedlots with 1,000 or more animals. California's LGMA imposed the larger buffers. The vote Friday, according to officials with the California LGMA, will strengthen its mandatory food safety practices for farms in order ""to protect consumers and prevent future foodborne illness outbreaks.""  ""The California Leafy Greens Marketing Agreement Board of Directors have adopted additional requirements to reduce risk when it comes to water used in growing lettuce and leafy greens,"" said Scott Horsfall, CEO of the California Leafy Greens Marketing Agreement (LGMA). ""This means that every box of leafy greens placed into commerce by a certified LGMA member will now be produced under new, more stringent requirements. We have effectively changed the way leafy greens are farmed."" The new standards approved by the LGMA board are in direct response to investigations conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration into the 2018 E. coli outbreaks involving romaine lettuce. A group of leafy greens industry members, growers and scientists have been working for several months in an effort, facilitated by Western Growers, to update LGMA requirements for agricultural water use. The updates include specific directives such as no longer allowing the use of untreated surface water for overhead irrigation of leafy greens prior to harvest. Horsfall explained the LGMA program has always required growers to test their water because it can easily carry pathogens. But the new requirements now include additional safeguards that ensure farmers categorize the source of their water; consider how and when water is applied to their crops; conduct testing to assure the water is safe for the intended uses; sanitize water if necessary; and verify that all of the precautions have been taken. ""The way to improve the safety of leafy greens is through the LGMA,"" said Horsfall explaining this unique program exists only in the leafy green industry to enforce science-based food safety practices and includes certified government audits of farms to verify the required methods are being followed. The LGMA's food safety practices meet, and often exceed, what is required under federal Produce Safety Rule regulations for other produce crops. ""For example, testing of irrigation water is currently not required by federal law,"" said Horsfall. ""But the actions taken by the LGMA board today (Friday) strengthen existing water testing and treatment requirements for 99 percent of the leafy greens grown in California."" A grower who is also chairman of the LGMA board says farmers must take responsibility for the food they produce. ""Leafy greens farmers have an obligation to produce safe leafy greens,"" said Dan Sutton, chairman of the LGMA and general manager of Pismo-Oceano Vegetable Exchange, a producer of lettuce and other vegetables near San Luis Obispo. ""We are keenly aware of the tragic impacts of foodborne illness. This is why we are so passionately committed to producing the safest leafy greens possible. To validate this commitment and compliance with food safety practices, we participate in the LGMA program which requires mandatory government audits of our farms."" The president of a Markon, a California company that distributes fresh produce for foodservice companies throughout the U.S. and Canada, says the LGMA is crucial for the future of the leafy greens industry. ""Markon and its members are committed to buying leafy greens from certified members of the LGMA,"" said Markon president Tim York. ""We believe the LGMA is the best tool we have to ensure consumer safety for leafy greens. I encourage all buyers of leafy greens to purchase only from LGMA members. I'd consider anything less both irresponsible and reckless."" The LGMA will begin immediately to make sure everyone in the leafy greens community understands how to comply with the new requirements. Additional information on specific changes to the LGMA food safety practices will be provided in the coming weeks and a webinar for retail and foodservice operations will be scheduled soon, according to the organization's officials.

The latest count is up to at least 535 cases in 18 states, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. That is 21 more cases and an additional state since CDC's report last week. And after a week of waiting, the  production and shipment of salad mix, leafy greens and salad mix from Taylor Farms de Mexico to the United States was halted as of Aug. 9, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said Monday. By Aug. 2  FDA had informed CDC that the traceback investigation had concluded he prepackaged salad mix blamed by Iowa and Nebraska health officials for the outbreak in those states had come from Taylor Farms in Mexico.  But it took a full week until Aug. 9, that those shipments were stopped by the producer. ""To date only the salad mix has been implicated in the outbreak of cyclosporiasis in Iowa and Nebraska, "" FDA's statement said.  ""This voluntary action goes beyond the implicated salad mix and includes iceberg lettuce, romaine lettuce, green leaf lettuce, red cabbage, green cabbage and carrots."" Taylor has promised not to resume shipments until FDA approves, which apparently pleased the agency.  ""The action of Taylor Farms de Mexico exemplifies the company's cooperation with federal and state officials throughout this ongoing, complicated investigation,"" said FDA. CDC's Aug 12 report had a cutoff for inclusion of Aug. 9. The current distribution of the outbreak cases is as follows: Texas (215), Iowa (153), Nebraska (86), Florida (27), Wisconsin (10), Illinois (9), Arkansas (5), Georgia (5), Missouri (4), Kansas (3), Louisiana (3), New Jersey (2), Ohio (2), Virginia (2), Connecticut (1), Minnesota (1), New Hampshire (1), and New York (6). A handful of the cases were likely acquired out of the states where they are reported. Most of the onset dates range from mid-june to mid-July and a total of 32 have required hospitalization, according to CDC. While Iowa and Nebraska have concluded the source of the Cyclospora outbreak is those states is a salad mix produced from Mexican grown produce, CDC says it is continuing to work with the other states to determine if that product is responsible for the entire outbreak. CDC continues to say it is not clear whether all 535 cases are part of the same outbreak or whether it is multiple outbreaks. And additional cases are under investigation, the agency said. It said: ""Cases in this outbreak are defined as laboratory-confirmed Cyclospora infection in a person with onset of illness since June 2013 and no history of travel outside of the United States or Canada during the 14 days prior to onset of illness.""

In the latest motion, federal defense attorney Thomas G. Ledford says his client, Mary Wilkerson, needs access to the index numbering system the government is using to track and locate the documents. Wilkerson is one of four former PCA executives scheduled for a federal criminal trial in February. She is charged with two obstruction of justice counts. In what's been a continuing theme from her defense, Wilkerson wants the government to disclose its law enforcement, investigative, expert, and informant witnesses ahead of the trial. Ledford's motion asks the government to reveal the names, employer or agency names, job titles, mailing addresses and phone numbers for all potential witnesses so that he may prepare Wilkerson's defense. The motion specifically says the government needs to produce the ""Bates Number Reference Guide"" being used to organize the documents. ""While the government in said response dated Sept. 6, 2013, stated that it was beginning to create a Bates Number Reference Guide, the Defendant points out that she still has not received one,"" Ledford writes in his latest motion. ""The Defendant hereby requests that the Government produce said Bates Number Reference Guide since it has been involved in this case about five years and the Trial is scheduled for Feb. 10, 2014, less than four months away,"" the motion states. The Wilkerson defense also says it requires not only the software and hardware for the system being used by the government to manage the documents, but also training on how to use it. The government has until Nov. 15 to respond to defense motions, and many were filed in the pre-trial sparring that has marked the case so far. Wilkerson is one of four PCA executives, charged with a total of 76 federal felony counts, who will be tried together in February before U.S. District Court Judge W. Louis Sands in Albany, GA. The others are PCA's top officers, Steward and Michael Parnell, and the former Blakely plant manager, Samuel Lightsey. The Parnell brothers have asked for separate trials. The trial involving conspiracy and fraud is occurring about five years after contaminated peanut butter and paste from PCA plants in Georgia and Texas were linked to a nationwide outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium. The outbreak sickened 700 and killed nine people, ending with one of the largest ingredient recalls in U.S. history, involving almost 4,000 products. PCA was headquartered in Lynchburg, VA.

Vulto Creamery is recalling the cheese from retailers and distributors nationwide. It's been more than five months since the first outbreak victim became sick on Sept. 1, 2016, but federal officials said Jos Vulto, owner of the Walton, NY, cheese operation initiated the recall as soon as he heard about the ""cannot rule out"" test results on his cheese. He began pulling cheese back from his customers March 3 and posted the public recall Tuesday. Since then, the Food and Drug Administration has confirmed Listeria monocytogenes in Vulto's finished product, according to an outbreak notice posted by the agency this morning. The FDA and other state and federal agencies have been investigating the outbreak since Jan. 31. The most recent illness began on Jan. 22. Confirmed victims are from Vermont, New York, Connecticut and Florida. All six required hospitalization. Two died. Victims' ages range from less than one year to 89, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All six outbreak victims ate soft cheeses before becoming sick. The outbreak strain of Listeria has been confirmed in open cheese from a victim's home and in finished cheese at the Vulto operation. Public health officials are concerned that contaminated cheese may be in consumers' homes and are urging people to check for the recalled cheese. Anyone who has eaten the recalled cheese and developed symptoms of Listeria infection should seek medical attention. Consumers who have eaten the recalled cheese are also urged to monitor themselves for the coming weeks for signs of Listeria infection. It can take up to 70 days after exposure for symptoms to develop. Symptoms can include high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Vulto Creamery stopped production and launched the nationwide recall Tuesday for four varieties of its raw milk cheeses. Whole Foods Market reinforced the recall with its own on Wednesday, recalling Vulto cheese from its stores and urging consumers not to eat any they may have in their homes. All lots of Vulto Creamery's Ouleout, Miranda, Heinennellie and Willowemoc soft wash-rind raw milk cheeses are being recalled, according to the recall notice on the Food and Drug Administration's website. In an unusual move, the company is requesting that the cheese be returned, rather than destroyed. Some public health officials are concerned that the Listeria bacteria could cross contaminate other foods and storage areas if the recalled Vulto cheeses are not disposed of immediately. Jos Vulto, owner of the creamery, did not immediately respond to a request for comment today. In his recall notice he offered consumers refunds and asked them to return unused Vulto cheese to retailers. ""Consumers that have any of these soft raw milk cheeses from Vulto Creamery should return the cheese to the (point of) purchase location for a refund,"" according to the recall notice. ""Food and cheese wholesalers and retailers with any of the Vulto Creamery soft, wash-rind raw milk cheeses on hand should immediately remove these products from common storage coolers and quarantine these cheeses in a secured area of a cooler. Any wholesaler or distributor that has any of the four cheeses should contact Vulto Creamery to receive instructions on what to do with the cheese. No recalled cheese should be destroyed until Vulto Creamery has been notified and agrees."" Vulto Creamery distributed the raw milk cheeses -- made from unpasteurized milk -- nationwide. Most were sold at retail locations in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic States, California, Chicago, Portland and Washington D.C., according to the recall.

",Vulto Creamery,"Ouleout, Miranda, Heinennellie and Willowemoc soft wash-rind raw milk cheeses",Listeria monocytogenes contamination,Listeria infection,6,Nationwide4835," Last month, when health officials reported they discovered a pathogenic connection between raw milk from a Pennsylvania dairy and two illnesses in 2014 -- one in California and the other in Florida -- a wave of disbelief and condemnation began rippling out from the raw milk community. News stories about the announcement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sparked a flurry of online comments from raw milk drinkers and producers who disparaged the government's science and scientists. A common thread through many of the posts was disbelief that laboratory analysis could actually prove the pathogen samples from the two patients and the dairy were the same strain of Listeria monocytogenes. Raw milk advocates questioned why the CDC said only that the samples were ""closely related genetically"" and that Miller's Organic Farm in Pennsylvania was the ""likely source."" Conspiracy theories about a big government agenda to destroy the raw milk industry emerged as fans of unpasteurized raw dairy products questioned why a specific dairy was being targeted when the CDC would not definitively state their lab analysis was 100 percent correct. Two million base pairs can't be wrong The CDC used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to analyze the DNA of the Listeria from a sample of Miller's Organic Farm raw milk. That DNA fingerprint of ""about 2 million base pairs"" was then fed into the PulseNet database, said Matthew Wise, the Outbreak Response Team Lead in CDC's Division of Foodborne, Waterborne, and Environmental Diseases. The database already included the DNA fingerprints from the Listeria monocytogenes that sickened the California and Florida patients. When the CDC scientists added the database and ran a search for matches, the connection was discovered. Matthew Wise ""As scientists, we couch it with a little uncertainty, though,"" Wise said. ""Because we are scientists we know new information can be discovered on Wednesday that we didn't have on Tuesday."" Wise said when CDC scientists say something is the ""likely source"" of an outbreak it has much stronger meaning than the general public probably realizes. ""When we say  'a likely source' it means we have two different lines of evidence showing the same result. It means we are very, very confident we know the source,"" Wise said. Similarly, when the CDC reports a pathogen isolate from sick people is ""closely related genetically"" to a pathogen isolate from a specific food source, the agency isn't talking about a shirt-tail relative situation. ""Closely related genetically for us means in the realm of identical twins,"" Wise said. Identical twins are genetically identical because they come from the same egg. They have the same DNA fingerprint, according to the National Institutes of Health, even though their actual fingerprints don't match. Raw milk advocates speak out In addition to doubting the science behind the CDC's report of the connection between the Pennsylvania raw milk and the Listeria patients in California and Florida, raw milk advocates say the government lied about the Florida patient's cause of death. The patient in California reported drinking raw milk before becoming ill, according to the CDC's report. Family members of the Florida patient, who ""died as a result of listeriosis,"" told outbreak investigators that the patient drank raw milk before becoming ill. The family ""reported purchasing raw milk from Miller's Organic Farm,"" the CDC reported Storage area for raw dairy products at Miller's Organic Farm. The Weston A. Price Foundation of Washington D.C., which is a non-profit group that annually produces an international raw milk trade show and conference, claims a family member of the Florida patient says the woman died as a result of cancer and chemotherapy treatment. A woman identified by the Price Foundation as Peggy Stevenson, who purports to be the sister-in-law of the son of the Florida patient, said through the foundation that she was a caregiver for the patient. ""My family member was diagnosed with and died of cancer after a week of chemo,"" Stevenson said in the Price Foundation news release. ""I am outraged that the CDC is using our tragic situation to damage and try to destroy a farm we love and support."" Attempts to reach Stevenson were unsuccessful. The Price Foundation did not respond to a request for assistance in reaching Stevenson for comment. The foundation's president Sally Fallon Morell said in the release that the CDC report is just plain wrong. ""This recent release from the CDC is a deliberate attempt to tarnish raw milk and present false and defamatory information,"" Morell said in the release. ""This is a witch-hunt against raw milk. This is clearly not a case of illness associated with raw milk, but rather an agency with an agenda."" A spokeswoman with the CDC said the agency does not routinely determine the cause of death, which is reported to the federal agency by the state where the death occurred. ""In this outbreak where raw milk was implicated, the Florida Department of Health informed CDC that an ill person in Florida died as a result of listeriosis. This is typically based on information gathered through a review of medical records and the death certificate,"" the CDC spokeswoman said. Florida officials confirmed Monday that they reported to the CDC that there was a Listeria patient in 2014 who died, but the state cannot release extensive details to the public. ""We cannot comment on details relating to a specific individual due to patient confidentiality,"" said Mara Gambineri, communications director for the Florida Department of Health. "" ""However, I can confirm that we did have a case of listeriosis in Florida related to Miller's Organic Dairy Farm and that the person did pass away. We cannot comment on cause of death."" The CDC didn't find the connections between the 2014 illnesses in Florida and California until early this year because sequencing the listeria DNA in the raw milk from Miller's Organic Farm didn't begin until late in 2015. In November, public health officials in California collected samples of the unpasteurized raw milk from Pennsylvania during the Price Foundation's annual raw milk conference. DNA sequencing helps detect outbreaks faster In addition to discovering outbreaks after the fact, officials and scientists from local to federal levels say DNA fingerprinting of pathogens helps identify outbreaks while they are happening, which means fewer people are exposed.  The Listeria Whole Genome Sequencing Project, launched in September 2013, had cracked the DNA code on about 2,300 isolates by February 2015, according to the CDC's project website. State laboratories, the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, and the National Center for Biotechnology Information are collaborating on the project. ""What we eat and how we eat in the United States has changed. In the early 1900s, most food was consumed close to where it was produced. Food safety gaps were usually discovered only when groups of people in the same location became ill, such as picnics or schools,"" according to the CDC's website. ""In the last half-century, food production has become increasingly centralized, and food products are often transported great distances before arriving at our dinner tables. Illnesses caused by errors in food production can sicken people over a wide area and may not be recognized as a problem in any one community."" Before technology advances made whole genome sequencing (WGS) fast and affordable, the CDC and FDA mostly relied on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) molecular typing to identify foodborne pathogens. The CDC's Wise said PFGE was helpful, but not even in the same ballpark as WGS in terms of detecting or investigating foodborne illness outbreaks. He said some Salmonella, for example, have PFGE results that are very similar when the Salmonella isn't related and vice versa. ""WGS gives us more certainty that two isolates are the same,"" Wise said. ""And it shows us more than PFGE, such as antibiotic resistance. WGS is altering the landscape of foodborne outbreak investigation. It's an incredible toe hold for investigators."" The value of WGS had already been proven As more isolates of pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes, E. coli and Salmonella are decoded by WGS, the more connections between seemingly unrelated illnesses will be discovered, Wise said. The WGS technique helped detect a Listeria outbreak in 2014 linked to caramel apples. In that outbreak, 35 people in 12 states contracted listeriosis from eating caramel apples. Seven people died. Ultimately the California apple grower-shipper who supplied the apples recalled its entire crop of galas and granny smiths, which health officials say reduced the number of people who got sick. In 2015, WGS connected 24 illnesses reaching back to 2010. The source was found to be soft cheeses produced by Karoun Dairies of San Fernando, CA. ""Suddenly, we went from just a few cases ... to upwards of 20,"" epidemiologist Brenda Jackson told Food Safety News in 2015. ""Once we had those numbers, it was fairly easy to see that there was a signal for soft cheese."" Whole genome sequencing also helped investigators with the 2011 E. coli O104:H4 outbreak in Europe, which prompted a rapid scientific response.

That's according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group formed in 1971. Some stores routinely post recall notices where shoppers are likely to see them. Yet others, such as Pittsburgh, PA-based Giant Eagle, do not, according to CSPI's survey. The group noted that still others, such as Whole Foods and Aldi, would not reveal their recall notification policies. Most chains responding to the CSPI survey post product recall notices in their stores, but the placement varies. Some post recalls at store entrances, some at cash registers, and some where the recalled product had been removed from store shelves, CSPI reported. FSMA requires FDA to put together recall notices using producer information, which grocery chains of 15 stores or larger would then post in easily visible locations for two weeks. However, CSPI states that FDA has yet to adopt this notification system even though FSMA was signed into law in January 2011. In a letter sent Wednesday to FDA Deputy Commissioner Stephen Ostroff, CSPI's senior staff attorney, David W. Plunkett, wrote that FDA has so far only conducted one public hearing and issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking about the recall notification process. ""We surveyed the leading chains for the report and found that most already post notices in the store. The practice, however, is not universal, demonstrating that voluntary actions, while laudable, cannot replace mandatory rules,"" Plunkett told Ostroff in the letter. The survey, detailed in CSPI's report ""Building a Food Recall System that Really Protects Consumers,"" also asked retailers if they use data collected by loyalty cards or other programs to directly notify consumers who have purchased recalled foods. The top three -- Walmart, Kroger and Costco -- said that they do directly notify consumers. Others, such as Publix, H-E-B and Whole Foods, don't have loyalty cards or frequent shopper programs that collect data. Food Lion, Cub Foods and Winn-Dixie, which indicated that they do collect such data, didn't disclose whether they use it to notify consumers about recalls, CSPI reported. CSPI recommended that consumers keep an eye out for recall notices in supermarkets and safely dispose of, or return, recalled products.

The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) and Federal Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL) said a factor in the decline was the coronavirus pandemic. In 2020, the two entities received significantly fewer reports of foodborne disease outbreaks than in previous years. In total, 193 outbreaks were reported with 1,143 illnesses, 174 hospitalizations and four deaths compared to 402 outbreaks, 1,970 illnesses, 385 hospitalizations and five deaths in 2019. As in previous years, the most common causes this past year were Campylobacter and Salmonella. However, Salmonella and Campylobacter infections decreased by 46 percent and 22 percent, respectively, based on calculations by the Robert Koch Institute. Other pathogens that caused outbreaks were norovirus, Bacillus cereus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), Clostridium perfringens, hepatitis A and E viruses, Listeria monocytogenes, histamines, and Giardia lamblia. The agent was unknown in 10 outbreaks that affected 50 people. COVID-19 impactMeasures to control the pandemic may be at least partially responsible for the decline in reported foodborne infections and outbreaks, said RKI and BVL. Hygiene such as frequent handwashing can also reduce transmission of foodborne diseases. The closure of restaurants, canteens and cafeterias, as well as cancelled or smaller events with fewer people and without catering facilities, likely reduced the amount of incidents, according to the report. The agencies added it was possible that infections and outbreaks were also under-recorded, as people with gastrointestinal symptoms may have sought treatment less often for fear of contracting COVID-19 plus the reduced diagnosis and reporting. Bacillus cereus caused four of 15 outbreaks with high evidence, as defined by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), affecting 96 people. Campylobacter and Clostridium perfringens were behind three each with 13 and 64 people sick respectively. Two were due to histamine and Salmonella with 14 and 231 sick including 52 hospitalizations. One was caused by Listeria with 35 sick, 31 hospitalizations and three deaths. It is believed to have been caused by smoked trout fillets from Denmark. Campylobacter and raw milk was the most frequently reported combination of pathogen and causative food with three outbreaks. Others that occurred twice were Bacillus cereus in rice, and histamine in tuna. Large outbreak traced to dried coconutThe largest outbreak sickened 161 people and was caused by Salmonella Muenchen. In total, 37 people were hospitalized. It was traced to dried coconut pieces imported from Mozambique. The second largest, with 70 cases and 15 hospitalizations, was caused by Salmonella Brandenburg. It was linked to a kebab shop in Saxony-Anhalt. Contributing factors to high evidence outbreaks included inadequate heat treatment; failure to comply with time or temperature storage conditions; inadequate cooling, and cross contamination. For 178 outbreaks, the evidence of a link between a food and the diseases was judged as low. Campylobacter caused 95 of these outbreaks while Salmonella was behind 41 of them. Overall, at least 690 people fell ill, 90 were hospitalized and one person died. Four STEC outbreaks sickened 38 people and five Yersinia outbreaks affected 10 people. There were 126 cases in nine norovirus outbreaks, 41 patients in one hepatitis A outbreak and six affected in three hepatitis E outbreaks.

The ground beef items were produced on Aug. 16, 2018. The following products are subject to recall: The recalled beef products bear the establishment number ""EST. 86R"" inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to warehouses in California and Colorado. The problem was discovered on Aug. 22 by the establishment when they reviewed their records and determined that the product may be associated with the product that was presumptive positive for E. coli O157: H7. The company then notified FSIS. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a healthcare provider. E. coli O157: H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2-8 days (3-4 days, on average) after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately. FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' refrigerators or freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160degF. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

The outbreak, which was first announced on April 5, 2019, has spread to six Canadian provinces: British Columbia (27), Alberta (12), Saskatchewan (9), Manitoba (10), Ontario (13) and Quebec (2). The outbreak began in early November 2018 and remains ongoing, with the most recent case having been reported in late March 2019. Outbreak victims range in age between 1 and 88 years of age. PHAC has not determined whether or not Salmonella was a contributing factor in either of the deaths. Nineteen outbreak victims have been hospitalized. Many of the victims reported eating Celebrate brand classic/classical or egg nog flavored profiteroles or mini chocolate eclairs purchased at various grocery stores before becoming ill. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has issued a Food Recall Warning for certain Celebrate brand products. The implicated products were manufactured in Thailand by Mountain Mist (The Belgian Baker) Thailand Ltd. and distributed in Canada by Retail Resource Services Inc., located in Beaumont, Alberta, Canada (Retail Resource). All lot codes of the following Celebrate brand products have been recalled so far. CFIA warns that more products may be recalled, depending on the outcome of its food safety investigation. The recalled products were sold in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan and may have been distributed elsewhere in Canada. Symptoms of Salmonella usually begin from 6 to 72 hours after exposure and may include the following: fever, chills, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, headache, nausea, and vomiting. In healthy individuals, symptoms usually last from 4 to 7 days and often resolve without treatment. In some cases, more severe illness can occur. The very young, the elderly, pregnant women, and individuals with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to complications from Salmonella infections.

Some of the recalled products have a shelf life through September of next year. ""(The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service) FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase,"" according to the recall notice. FSIS posted the recall on Oct. 3, reporting the ham products were shipped to distributors in Maryland, North Carolina, New York, South Carolina and Virginia. The notice did not indicate if those distributors sent the ham to other states. When available, FSIS will post retail distribution information on its website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls. The ready-to-eat ham items were produced from April 3, 2017, through Oct. 2, 2018. They all have the establishment number ""EST. M2646"" printed inside the USDA mark of inspection on their packaging. The FSIS posted photos of the products' labels on its website. To identify the recalled products, look for the following label information: A week before the recall, on Sept. 27, the FSIS received notification that a person ill with listeriosis reported consuming a ham product produced at Johnston County Hams. Listeriosis is an infection caused by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. The USDA's sub-agency has been working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state public health and agriculture officials on an investigation. The FSIS determined there is a link between the Listeria monocytogenes illnesses and ham products produced at Johnston County Hams. The epidemiologic investigation identified four confirmed listeriosis illnesses, including one death, between July 8, 2017, and Aug. 11 this year. FSIS had collected two ham product samples from the Johnston County Hams Inc. facility in 2016 and in early 2018. Whole genome sequencing results showed that Listeria monocytogenes identified in the ham from both years had the same DNA fingerprint as Listeria monocytogenes isolated from samples from the sick people. Federal and state public health officials are working to determine if there are additional illnesses linked to these products and will provide updated information should it become available. Advice for the publicConsumption of food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected. It can take more than two months after exposure for listeriosis symptoms to develop. Symptoms can include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions, sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. People in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

Healthy SoyNut Butters and all varieties of I.M. Healthy Granola products. On March 10, 2017, The SoyNut Butter Company expanded its recall to include Dixie Diner's Club brand Carb Not Beanit Butter.  This after poisoning over 30 people - mostly kids - several that suffered from acute kidney failure. The recall notice, drafted by I.M. Healthy, on the FDA website did not mention where the tainted product was sold. Nearly six months later Food Safety News reported on September 5: ""Earlier today, Amazon.com was still selling I.M. Healthy soy nut butter that was recalled in March when federal officials traced an E. coli outbreak to the product.""  Then on September 26 a friend of a client whose son nearly died from consuming the soy nut butter found the product on ""Close Out"" at Lucky's Market on 200 Woodside Rd, Redwood City, CA 94061. So, why does the FDA not release the names of retailers to retailers and consumers during a recall and/or an outbreak? Caitlin Dewey of The Washington Post asked the same question in March of this year - ""Why the FDA hides the names of grocery stores that sell contaminated food.""  I reread it today and it still makes my head hurt. According to Caitlin: The FDA does not specify, however, which stores, centers or schools -- because that would violate its interpretation of an obscure trade secret rule.  This interpretation differs from that of other agencies in the federal food safety system, an overlapping and often illogical network of regulatory fiefdoms. The system, which is responsible for keeping food free of bacteria and other pathogens, frequently has to weigh the very real interests of private food companies against potential risks to the public. In the case of releasing retailer lists during major outbreaks, the FDA has historically sided with business, ruling that such lists constitute ""confidential commercial information"" and thus should not be available for public consumption.  Critics say that the agency's unwillingness to share this information poses a clear danger to public health, particularly in cases like the current E. coli outbreak, where parents may not know if their child consumed the recalled product.   ""Our mantra is that a more transparent food system is a safer food system,"" said Thomas Gremillion, the director of food policy at the Consumer Federation of America. ""And there are lots of instances where having that distribution list would help victims of food-borne illness."" The FDA's current recall process has been in effect for years, though the agency did gain more recall authority under the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011. It is, for the most part, a voluntary system -- which means there's some variance in how quickly recalls happen. While most companies are highly motivated to clean up any contamination, it takes time to evaluate and respond to possible threats. And that time can be multiplied several times over if a product has moved through the hands of several distributors, manufacturers or other middlemen, an issue that the FDA was faulted for in a June 2016 alert by the Inspector General's Office. When a company does issue a recall, it has wide latitude over the amount of information it shares; in some cases, a recall will never be made public. Recalls that are made public typically contain a description of the product and an explanation of the problem. But companies are not required to reveal where the product was sold -- whether to a store, a school, a restaurant or another manufacturer that put it in other products. The recall for SoyNut Butter, for instance, says that ""products were distributed in multiple states and may have been purchased in stores or through mail order. They were also distributed to childcare centers and schools in multiple states."" Those states include Virginia and Maryland, where two people have fallen ill. I.M. Healthy did not respond to a phone call or email requesting comment, though a statement on its website called the contamination ""deeply concerning"" and said that the company had immediately issued a recall. A list compiled by the site eFoodAlert claims that the product was sold at a number of major grocery chains, including Kroger, Giant and Whole Foods. ""Industry argues that they don't want to turn over who they sell to, because competition will know and try to undercut them,"" said Bill Marler, a prominent food safety lawyer who is representing the parents of one of the children sickened in the SoyNut outbreak. ""That's all well and good under normal circumstances. But those rules should not and do not apply to a product that could cause people to become ill."" In a statement to The Washington Post, the FDA affirmed that it believes its disclosure measures are sufficient and blamed the lack of downstream recall information on federal disclosure rules. Federal regulations do limit the sort of information that can be released to the public. Under the Freedom of Information Act and Title 21 of the Code of Regulations, government agencies -- and specifically, the FDA -- are told to exempt trade secrets and commercial information from any of their releases. ""Examples of [confidential consumer information] include raw material supplier lists, finished product customer lists, trace back information, etc.,"" said Peter Cassell, a spokesman for the FDA. ""CCI is exempt from Freedom of Information Act requests, but can be shared through certain information sharing agreements (including with other Federal agencies)."" ""The FDA publicizes recall notices, including pictures of affected products, and uses social media accounts to reach consumers as swiftly as possible,"" he later added. ""In some cases, the FDA can release certain information that is otherwise exempt from disclosure if it is necessary to effectuate a recall. In many cases, it is most efficient for the company to directly notify its distributors so they can take appropriate action."" Cassell declined to make an agency lawyer available for comment or explain how the FDA had arrived at its definitions. But it's probably worth noting that when another agency considered similar precedents, it came to different conclusions. In the early 2000s, the Food Safety and Inspection Service -- the branch of the U.S. Department of Agriculture that regulates meat, poultry and egg products -- decided to revisit its own interpretation of the trade secrets rule. During a lengthy comments period, industry groups concerned with protecting their distribution lists from competitors faced off against consumer advocates. In 2008, after several years of debate, FSIS's final rule concluded that it would ""not cause substantial harm to the competitive position of any business"" to disclose retailer names. ""FSIS now routinely posts these lists,"" said Deirdre Schlunegger, the chief executive of STOP Foodborne Illness, an advocacy group for patients that lobbied FSIS 10 years ago. ""We obviously believe consumers should have as much information as possible to make safe food decisions."" Today, when FSIS issues a Class I recall -- those that seem ""reasonably"" likely to cause health problems -- it also issues a list of all the retail locations that have, or have had, the product. During last month's massive cheese recall, for instance, FSIS published a list of every Safeway, Albertsons and Pak 'n' Save that sold Taylor Farms salads containing Sargento pepperjack. But because FDA regulates the cheese itself, there was no such list of stores that sold the cheese outside salads. ""It does makes me wonder why the FDA can't do the same,"" said Sandra Eskin, the director of the Safe Food Project at Pew Charitable Trusts. ""The fundamental issue is -- is this information important to consumers during a recall? I would argue yes."" But the man who led the effort to reform FSIS's traded secrets rule has his own suspicions as to why the FDA hasn't followed his lead. Richard Raymond, who was the undersecretary of agriculture for food safety under President George W. Bush, says that the fiercest opposition to the change came from the food industry. Raymond, who had been the chief medical officer in his home state of Nebraska, came to Washington, D.C., determined to change the rules on confidential information. He found himself surprised by the level of resistance. ""They were scared to death it would hurt their business,"" Raymond said. ""The retail stores want to protect their brand. ... When you ask why FDA hasn't done it, I suspect they don't want that fight themselves."" The FDA did not respond to Raymond's comment by press time. But Gremillion, of the Consumer Federation, would like to see the agency take action. ""Why do confidential business interests trump public health in some cases and not others?"" he asked. ""We need more transparency around this. I think it is past time for the FDA and the industries it oversees to be transparent - willingly or not.

The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) has not been able to identify the source of the Salmonella that has recently infected at least seven people. All seven report eating at the Joe &amp; The Juice restaurant at the Oslo Airport recently while traveling.  Joe &amp; The Juice, a Danish-born juice bar and coffee shop once found mostly in European airports, is opening location this year from San Francisco to Chicago. NIPH is monitoring the outbreak to determine if it will be limited to the existing cases or if it will grow larger. The same DNA ""fingerprint"" for Salmonella typhimurium bacteria has been confirmed in all seven victims, suggesting a common source. While the same airport restaurant connects the sickened individuals, their residences are disconnected, scattered throughout the country. The NIPH investigation began in August when the victims began experiencing diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain. The typhimurium stereotype of Salmonella bacteria causes more severe symptoms than other Salmonella varieties. Norway sees only about 1,200 to 2,000 Salmonella illnesses annually. About 70 percent of those are from infections contracted outside of the country. Most of the other infections are from imported foods. Food produced in Norway and Norwegian livestock are rarely sources of Salmonella contamination. Some strains of the bacterium have become established among wild Norwegian fauna, particularly among small birds and hedgehogs. Every year, these Salmonella strains do cause instances of disease in humans. However, a nationwide Salmonella outbreak in Norway in 2013 involved the serotype Coeln, sickening 26 people from age 2 to 81. A pre-cut salad mix was determined to be the likely cause of that outbreak. More international travel and more imported foods are combining to keep Salmonella as the second most common diarrheal disease in Norway. Salmonellosis is the illness caused by Salmonella exposure. It is food poisoning caused by the bacterium. There are many different kinds of these bacteria. Salmonellosis spikes in the summer months. Children, older adults, and anyone with impaired immune systems are the most likely to have severe infections. (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

The observations are found on U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 483 forms completed after four on-site investigations were conducted at the company's facility in Shafter, CA, from Dec. 23, 2014, to Jan. 6, 2015, along with a mostly public 16-page report. The investigative team, including officials from FDA and the California Department of Public Health, took samples from food and non-food contact surfaces in packing and common cold storage areas and from outside storage bins. Positives for Listeria monocytogenes came back for seven areas, and six of those were from direct food contact surfaces. Results of the on-site investigation last Jan. 6 caused Bidart Bros., one of northern California's best known fruit-growing families, to voluntarily recall all the Granny Smith and Gala apples that were processed during 2014 through their cooler-packing facility. Before that action, three distributors of caramel apples -- Happy Apples, California Snack Foods Inc. and Merb's Candies -- had recalled caramel apples they produced in response to the Listeria outbreak. That outbreak required the hospitalization of 34 of 35 people from 12 states who were sickened. Before the outbreak ended, seven of them were dead, and Listeriosis was blamed for the deaths of at least three of them. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was able to confirm that 31 of 35 (or about 90 percent) of those sickened in the outbreak had consumed caramel apples. Areas inside the Bidart Bros. packing plant where Listeria positives were found were on polishing brushes, drying brushes, packing line drain, inside a wood bin, and on an automatic line. ""On 12/23/2014, we observed direct food contact areas of packaging equipment, used during the 2014 apple season, constructed and/or maintained in a manner so that they cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized,"" according to one Form 483 observation. Also called out were a damaged conveyor belt with chipping and peeling paint on the transfer chute on the Granny's Best packaging line, and green vinyl-coated padding lining the transfer chute to the peeler had frayed edges and exposed foam-like material. The same problem with the vinyl coating was found on the entrance to the packaging area, on a flap, and on a pad at the end of a line. In addition, a bucket conveyer was frayed, cracked and torn. The inspection report noted that Bidart Bros. ""was very cooperative,"" making its packing manager, cold storage manager, general manager, sales manager and safety director available throughout the inspection process, as well as brothers Leonard and John Bidart and their brother-in-law Bob Sullivan. Bidart Bros., incorporated in 1983, grows apples, potatoes, oranges, lemons, table grapes and almonds. The company is headquartered in Bakersfield, CA, and also runs two calving operations. The owners are five siblings who are the grandchildren of Basque immigrant John Bidart, who came to California's Central Valley from France in the 1880s to grow potatoes and raise livestock. FDA made numerous redactions from its inspection report such as blackening out the number of acres the Bidarts own, along with their peak season employment and the names of their major interstate customers. The facility that was the target of the investigation was first used in 1987. Prior to that, Bidart Bros. sold apples directly to other packers. During the 2014 season, it shipped apples in 700-pound triwall bins to processors with only a pallet tag affixed to the shipment. Apples shipped for juice were sent in either the customer's bins or the Bidart Bros. wooden bins. Apples shipped for the fresh market were packed in 3-5-pound poly bags and 3-pound mesh bags. The FDA report notes that the team ""informed management that conditions observed may, after further review by the Agency, be considered to be violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or other statues and legal sanctions available to the FDA may include seizure, injection, civil money penalties, and prosecution.""

Neither this week's outbreak notice nor a June 21 health advisory from the Texas State Department of Health Services (DSHS) referenced an ongoing cyclosporiasis outbreak in four other states. At least 185 people are infected in that outbreak, which is associated with trays of pre-cut fresh vegetables from Del Monte.  ""DSHS is working with local health departments around the state and health departments in other states seeing an outbreak to gather information about the cases and determine whether there is a common source for the infections,"" according to the outbreak notice from Texas public health officials. This is the sixth consecutive year that the Texas health department has recorded a large number of illnesses from Cyclospora. Every year the concentration of cases has been from late spring through the end of summer. Investigations showed contaminated fresh cilantro from Mexico as the source of the parasites several times. ""Texas has had multiple outbreaks linked to cilantro,"" the state health department reported. ""... Cyclospora can be very difficult to wash off. Cooking will kill the parasite. Infection is generally not transmitted directly from person-to-person. There were 319 cases of cyclosporiasis in Texas reported last year. ""Rapid reporting to public health is essential to preventing additional cases of cyclosporiasis. Healthcare providers and laboratories are required to report confirmed cyclosporiasis cases to their respective local health department."" Other outbreaks of cyclosporiasis in the United States in recent years have been associated with consumption of imported fresh produce, including fresh cilantro, pre-packaged salad mix, raspberries, basil, snow peas, and mesclun lettuce. Symptoms of Cyclospora infection are often similar to intestinal viruses that resolve without medical treatment. Consequently, the state health department is urging people to seek medical attention if they have diarrhea for more than a few days. Similarly, public health officials have advised health care providers to consider testing patients for the parasite if they have diarrheal illness lasting more than a few days or diarrhea accompanied by severe anorexia or fatigue. In addition to producing symptoms that can be confused with other illnesses, cyclosporiasis requires special lab tests with specific doctor's orders. Even then, ""a single negative stool specimen does not exclude the diagnosis; three specimens are optimal,"" according to the warning from the Texas health department.   Cyclosporiasis is an intestinal illness caused by consuming food or water contaminated with the microscopic Cyclospora parasite. Symptoms usually begin 2 to 14 days after ingestion of the parasite.  The main symptom is watery diarrhea lasting a few days to a few months. Additional symptoms may include loss of appetite, fatigue, weight loss, abdominal cramps, bloating, increased gas, nausea, vomiting and a low fever. Symptoms may come and go multiple times over a period of weeks or months. (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

The first illness was reported July 17. The investigation is ongoing, but no specific cause has yet been found. The outbreak strain is believed to be E. coli O157, according to a department spokesman, which is not the one recently linked to Applebee's restaurants in Minnesota. The sickened reservation residents are being called and interviewed by a state epidemiologist, an environmental health supervisor and University of Minnesota graduate epidemiology students, the spokesman said.

Healthy ""SoyNut Butter"" was still on the shelf yesterday at a Luckys Market in California, according to the mother of an 8-year-old outbreak victim. ""We have friends all over the Bay Area who have been watching the situation since Trevor got sick in January,"" Erin Simmons said Wednesday. ""I couldn't believe it last night (Tuesday) when a friend sent me the photo of it on the shelf at the Luckys in Redwood City. ""I just can't imagine another family having to go through what we did because this was still on sale and could make people sick."" Officials with Luckys did not immediately respond Wednesday to a request for comment. Earlier this month a similar situation was discovered when a food safety researcher from the University of California-Davis, Linda Harris, noticed the recalled peanut butter substitute was still available for purchase on Amazon. Harris bought the recalled product and it was delivered in less than 24 hours. FDA and recall enforcementThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration is investigating the Luckys incident -- as it did the Amazon situation -- an agency spokeswoman said Wednesday, after Simmons filed a consumer complaint. ""Thanks for bringing this to our attention,"" the spokeswoman said in an email response to questions from Food Safety News. ""The FDA is investigating and can confirm product has been removed. We continue to follow up with online retailers and businesses as we become aware of recalled products being offered for sale. It is the responsibility of a recalling firm to ensure that a recall is effective."" It is a violation of federal law to sell recalled products, whether in retail or wholesale settings, thrift stores or yard sales, or any other venue. The recalled soy butter has been linked to 32 illnesses across a dozen states, with additional victims possible because the recall has not been completely effective. Simmons said her friend returned to the Luckys Market at 200 Woodside Road in Redwood City, CA, on Wednesday to find that the I.M. Healthy brand soy butter was no longer on the shelf. Which, Simmons said, surprised them both. ""He told me he went to the store four different times, talked to four different employees, and they didn't do anything. They just left it on the shelf for people to buy,"" Simmons said. Betrayed by 'them'Simmons said she feels betrayed as a consumer and a taxpayer; betrayed by the food industry and betrayed by the government. She said she's learned more than she ever wanted to know about foodborne pathogens, food laws and gaping holes in the safety net that is supposed to protect the public. ""As consumers, most moms don't think that the food in the grocery store will make their kids sick,"" Simmons said. ""We trust that there are rules and that the public good is protected. The most concerning thing about this still being for sale six months after the recall is how can we ever trust what we buy?"" Before her son's life-threatening bout with E. coli, Simmons didn't think much about the FDA or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Now, with her post-E. coli perspective, the California mom wants to know not only how poison food gets on the market, but why the government won't release specific distribution details about food recalled because of pathogens. Agency policy prohibits the FDA from releasing information about what wholesalers or retailers received foods when a recall is initiated. The policy is based on a clause in federal law that protects trade secrets, referred to as ""confidential corporate information"" (CCI). Simmons said that's just not good enough. ""How can people go to the grocery store and buy food for their families with any trust,"" she asked. Things will never be the sameSimmons youngest son, Trevor, is 9 now. He's back in school full time this fall after basically missing the entire spring semester because of his E. coli infection and complications. His doctor visits are down to once every three months instead of once a week. He spent 25 days in the hospital, went into kidney failure, endured dialysis and could have permanent damage -- it's too early to tell. One thing Trevor's parents do know now, and have known for months, is that their little boy is changed forever. He wrestles with post traumatic shock syndrome because one of his favorite foods almost killed him. He must overcome fear every time he eats now, his mother said. ""This has bruised our whole family,"" Simmons said. ""We've practically become OCD because we don't know what's safe. I don't want my kids to be OCD about food.

The Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA) last month advised people not to eat eggs stamped with the code 3-ES-4624944A because of Salmonella contamination. The agency added it was important to wash hands after touching them as the Salmonella can be found on the outside of the eggs. They were supplied to neighborhood supermarkets, market stalls and catering establishments that may have further processed them into various dishes. They are not thought to have been sold at large supermarket chains in the country. Salmonellosis is not a notifiable infection in the Netherlands. There were an estimated 27,440 patients with acute gastroenteritis due to salmonellosis in 2017. First illnesses this past yearThirty patients have been reported with an identical Salmonella Enteritidis type based on whole genome sequencing, some of which fell ill last year. At least five patients are known to have eaten eggs from the batch the NVWA issued a warning about, according to the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). Harald Wychgel, a RIVM spokesman, said because these studies ask people what they have eaten in recent weeks, it is not expected consumption of eggs can be confirmed for all patients. ""The outbreak has been going on since 2018 with a number of patients that is insufficient to initiate source detection. RIVM linked a small cluster of patients to a batch of eggs that were withdrawn from the market at the end of August,"" he told Food Safety News. ""Although there has been a recall, it may still be the case that patients will be found because they may still have products at home. The eggs in question have been traced by the NVWA and are withdrawn from the market."" Information from the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) shows the eggs were also distributed to Belgium. Symptoms of Salmonella infection can include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating contaminated food. Otherwise healthy adults are usually sick for four to seven days.

Anyone who has eaten any of the recalled products and developed symptoms of Listeria infection should seek medical treatment and tell their doctors about the possible Listeria exposure. Also, anyone who has eaten any of the recalled product should monitor themselves for symptoms during the coming weeks because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to Listeria for symptoms of listeriosis to develop. Symptoms of Listeria infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache and neck stiffness.

In March, a 31-year-old Muskegon County woman became ill after drinking raw milk, and, in April, a six-year-old child from Kent County became ill after possible consumption of the raw-milk product. Due to the health risk of consuming raw milk, it is not legal to sell raw milk or raw milk products in the state of Michigan. Because of this, raw milk is obtained through herd-share programs where consumers purchase a share of a cow, and, as an owner of the cow, are provided raw milk from the farmer. These herd-share dairy programs are not licensed or inspected by state or local agencies. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that unpasteurized milk is 150 times more likely to cause foodborne illness and results in 13 times more hospitalizations than illnesses involving pasteurized dairy products.

Meanwhile, corporate officials for Tiger Brands and its wholly owned subsidiary Enterprise Foods expressed dismay at comments from federal officials in South Africa. The government officials proclaimed the source of the Listeria monocytogenes responsible for the outbreak remains unknown, according to some members of the South African Parliament. The companies have recalled products because of the outbreak. The federal officials admitted that traces of listeria found at chicken ""polony"" plants operated by Enterprise and another much smaller processed meat producer were not the ""primary sources"" of the outbreak, according to a Wednesday statement from one of South Africa's political parties, the Democratic Alliance. ""Although traces of the bacterium has been found at Enterprise and Rainbow Chicken facilities, the departments have today confirmed the (Democratic Alliance's) suspicions that Rainbow and Enterprise factories are a source but not the primary sources of the outbreak,"" according to a prepared statement from Patricia Kopane, a member of Parliament from the Democratic Alliance party. ""It is now apparent that the government seems to be blaming bureaucratic processes and has opted for prematurely scapegoating Enterprise and Rainbow because it does not have proper emergency plans in place to contain this."" However, Dr. Lucia Anelich, a food safety expert in South Africa, told the Johannesburg Times she was unsure what was meant by ""primary source"" of the outbreak. ""We know that the outbreak strain of Listeria ST6, was found in the Enterprise plant, but it's true that we don't know its origin,"" Anelich told reporter Wendy Knowler. The outbreak strain that has been found in the Enterprise plant that produces the boloney-style ""polony,"" Vienna sausages and other processed meat is responsible for at least 91 percent of the 978 Listeria infections documented thus far, according to the World Health Organization.  Of the 674 illnesses for which the outcome is known, more than a fourth of them -- 183 -- resulted in deaths, according to a Wednesday update from WHO. Additional illnesses are expected, partly because it can take up to 70 days after exposure for symptoms of listeriosis to develop. If the report from the Democratic Alliance is accurate, it is incongruous with information from South Africa's public health officials, who have left little doubt about what is causing the outbreak that began in January 2017. Aaron Motsoaledi, the country's health minister, and Juno Thomas of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) have both repeatedly warned the public to avoid ready-to-eat processed meats ""until there is further clarity as to the extent of product contamination. ""The finding that the external casing of polony products sampled at the Enterprise Foods' Polokwane production facility were found to be contaminated with the outbreak strain of L. monocytogenes, which means that there was a likelihood of cross-contamination of other RTE processed meat products when stacked together in cold storage and refrigerators at retail level, including products of different brands from different manufacturers,"" Thomas said this week, the Times reported. The implicated processed meats are exported from South Africa to 15 countries in Africa, according to the WHO. All of those countries have issued recalls for the implicated products. Currently, 12 out of 15 banned imports of the same, while three out of these countries have additionally banned imports of other food products. While the outbreak strain of Listeria has not been found in the Rainbow production plant, investigators found another serotype of the pathogen there. However, food safety experts in South Africa and the United States say that fact is not as significant as corporate officials and some politicians may suggest. It's a ""not yet"" situation, according to Bill Marler, founding partner of the Seattle law firm Marler Clark LLP. He said it is likely only a matter time, and probably not a lot of time before laboratory testing shows a match between sick people and the Listeria serotype found in the Rainbow plant. Marler has been working with public officials, victim advocates, and industry officials in South Africa for several weeks. He said one of the things that complicated the identification and investigation of the outbreak is the fact that listeriosis was not a reportable disease in South Africa until December 2017, a which meant doctors and outbreak investigators were not asking victims what they had eaten recently. ""When they made it reportable, they started asking the sick people what they had eaten before they got ill and it went pretty quickly after that,"" Marler said Wednesday. The Seattle attorney is assisting one of South Africa's leading human rights attorneys, Richard Spoor, with the class action lawsuit filed by 10 victims and their families. It names Tiger Brands Limited and Enterprise Foods and was filed Wednesday in the High Court of South Africa. Highlights from the class action Editor's note: Bill Marler is the publisher of Food.

Conley, Jr., is allowed to testify as an expert witness in this summer's planned criminal trial of former Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) executives, Stewart Parnell's attorneys say it could help win an acquittal for their client. Conley is the clinical neuropsychologist who diagnosed Parnell, former chief executive officer of the now-defunct PCA, as suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). After last month's nearly seven hours of testimony over whether or not Conley should be designated as an expert witness, government and defense attorneys are now exchanging legal briefs on the issue. U.S. District Court Judge W. Louis Sands will eventually make the pre-trial decision. ""The government, both in its initial motion, and in its subsequent reply, ignores the fact that the Eleventh Circuit has adopted a rule stating that psychiatric evidence that offers to establish facts indicating that the defendant did not commit the crime is proper and admissible,"" wrote Roanoke, VA, defense attorney E. Scott Austin. Austin then continued, ""The rule is precisely the situation before this Court: Dr. Conley's testimony offers information to establish facts indicating that Parnell did not commit the crime the government alleges (because he lacks knowledge), and does not seek to introduce opinions into evidence indicating that Parnell could not help himself from committing the criminal acts alleged."" In February 2013, a federal grand jury charged Parnell and three others with a total of 76 federal felony counts. The indictment followed a four-year investigation into PCA's peanut butter business after it was associated with a national Salmonella outbreak that sickened 700 and killed nine in late 2008 and early 2009. Conspiracy and fraud, along with introducing adulterated food into interstate commerce, top the charges in the criminal case that has also been officially designated as ""complex."" Government and defense attorneys have been sparring since late 2013 over Conley's role in the coming jury trial, and Judge Sands last month held a one-day evidentiary hearing and then ordered the attorneys to brief the issues involved. Austin argues that Conley meets a three-part test for expert witnesses established by the U.S. Supreme Court in that he is qualified, used a reliable methodology, and would provide testimony that would assist the trier of fact. Conley is a licensed clinical psychologist in the Commonwealth of Virginia who claims to have made 8-10,000 ADHD evaluations over the course of his career. Austin claims the government has not challenged his qualifications. The defense also claims that Conley's methodology enjoys wide use and acceptance. The expert from Johns Hopkins brought in by the government said that the tests Conley administered on Parnell ""were pretty reasonable."" ""Dr. Conley's testimony will not confuse a jury and forms part of the factual context that the jury is empanelled to determine,"" Austin wrote. ""There is no risk that the jury will be distracted from focusing on the actual presence or absence of mens rea because the testimony offered by Dr. Conley does not even deal with Parnell's mens rea. The legal term ""mens rea"" is Latin for being of a guilty mind. It involves having prior intention to commit a criminal act, with the knowledge that the act is a crime. ""Rather, this testimony refutes the government's position that Parnell read and understood the emails and managed to orchestrate and implement a complicated scheme,"" Austin added. ""Likewise, there is no risk that the jury will be so confused by the testimony that it will be able to conclude that Parnell was somehow justified in committing the crimes alleged. Instead the jury will be presented with two factual contexts and be charged with determining which set of facts is correct or incorrect. Parnell denies committing any of the crimes alleged by the government and hence there is no need for any reliance on justifying his actions."" Government attorneys have not yet responded to Austin's brief but will likely do so in the next 48 hours. Thomas Jack Bondurant, also from Roanoke, and Atlanta attorneys Kenneth B.

It is the world's largest reported Listeria outbreak. The National Institute of Communicable Diseases said 915 cases of listeriosis had been confirmed since Jan. 1, 2017. Early last month, only 61 deaths had been confirmed. Listeriosis is caused by a natural bacteria found in soil, water, vegetation and animal feces and can contaminate food, especially meat, dairy, seafood and fresh produce. It is prevented by basic hygiene and washing food, but South African authorities say the source of the worsening outbreak is still unknown. The United Nations has said South Africa's listeriosis outbreak is believed to be the largest-ever worldwide. The disease has an incubation period of up to 70 days, making it difficult to traceback to specific sources. Most of the current cases have been in Gauteng province, which includes the cities of Johannesburg and Pretoria, with other cases concentrated in Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. Contamination in humans can result in flu-like illness, infection of the bloodstream, and, in severe cases, infection of the brain -- which can prove fatal. People with compromised immune systems, like some of those living with AIDS and pregnant women, are at a heightened risk, according to the World Health Organization. The WHO advises people to wash hands and kitchen surfaces, keep raw and cooked food separate, cook food thoroughly and store it in a refrigerator. The National Institute of Communicable Diseases said it is optimistic the source of the outbreak will be found and urged members of the public not to panic. It warned vulnerable people to avoid processed, ready-to-eat meat products such as ham and sausages, soft cheeses and unpasteurized milk and dairy products. South African authorities said specialized tests are being conducted by experts at the National Institute's laboratories to detect the source and end the outbreak. The source of the outbreak is thought to be a food product or range of products from one company, but that is still just a theory. Victims include people from various social and economic backgrounds.

More people fell victim to the parasite this week and an Iowa couple went to court seeking compensation for the indignity and suffering. They've sued Fresh Express, a national supplier of bagged salads. The number of Cyclospora outbreak cases jumped by almost 40 percent, according to this week's update. The case count jumped by 46 to 122 people with parasites in their intestines. That was up from 76 when the outbreak was first announced on June 19. According to a report on Nebraska's Health Alert Network, that state received its first Cyclospora reports on June 9. The outbreak's geographic footprint also expanded with Wisconsin becoming the seventh state with outbreak victims. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Cyclospora infections have been linked to bagged salad mixes containing carrots, red cabbage, and iceberg lettuce, purchased at ALDI, Hy-Vee and Jewel-Osco stores in Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. CDC advises consumers and retailers to not eat, sell, or serve the recalled product listed below. All are products linked to the parasite. These include: If any of these bagged salads are found, any remaining should be thrown away without eating any more of it. Anyone living in Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, Nebraska, North and South Dakota, and Wisconsin who've purchased garden salad without knowing where it came from should also toss the product, according to public health officials. Matthew Phillips, a plaintiff along with his wife, in the lawsuit became ill on June 3 and required hospital care on June 7. Tests confirmed Cyclospora and his medical care continued through June 20. The plaintiffs are represented by Bill Marler, the nationally known food safety lawyer, along with local counsel. They've charged Fresh Express with negligence. Marler, who is also the publisher of Food Safety News, predicts the parasite will take more victims and other retailers will be implicated in the outbreak. The CDC says the salads at ALDI, Hy-Vee, and Jewel-Osco do not explain all illnesses in the outbreak. The CDC along with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is also investigating the possibility of other products being a source of the outbreak. This week's updated report said three more people were hospitalized, bringing the total to 19. No deaths are blamed on the parasitic infections. The three retail grocery chains began recalling the contaminated bagged salad mixes on June 20, a day after the CDC announced the outbreak. Iowa has 54 of the 122 laboratory-confirmed Cyclospora infections. Illinois has 30 victims, the second most. Others with cases include Minnesota with 13, Wisconsin with 9, Nebraska with 8, Missouri with 7, and Kansas with 1. Illnesses started May 11 and continued through at least June 15. It can take weeks for reports of confirmed infections to reach the CDC. The victims range in age from 16 to 92 years. The median age is 63 with 45 percent being female. The CDC's latest update, for June 24, says there are typically clusters of Cyclospora infections that occur during the summer.

The reports are good news for more than 300 employees, some of whom have been laid off since late April when the plant ceased operations after CRF recalled hundreds of products under dozens of brands. Lab analysis of samples of the company's frozen corn and peas showed they were contaminated with the same strain of Listeria monocytogenes that had infected people in at least three states. ""Gene Grabowski, a consultant acting as spokesman for CRF during the crisis, said the company will turn its attention from trying to find the source of the deadly listeria pathogen to securing federal approval to restart production,"" the Kennewick, WA, Tri-City Herald newspaper reported Sunday. CRF, which is affiliated with R.D. Offutt Co. of Fargo, ND, hired Grabovski in recent weeks to help with public relations. He is known most recently for assisting Bluebell Creameries with its recall and public image after its ice cream was linked to a deadly listeria outbreak. Before the CRF plant reopens, it must gain approval from government authorities. The root cause of the Listeria monocytogenes remains a mystery, with neither the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention nor the Food and Drug Administration having posted any new information on the outbreak to investigation for weeks. In the CDC's last update, posted May 3, eight people in three states had been confirmed with listeriosis infections. The first victim became ill in September 2013 and the most recent victims' illnesses began in January and March this year. All eight victims required hospitalization and two died, but state health authorities did not consider the cause of their deaths to be listeriosis. The most recent update from the Food and Drug Administration on its investigation was posted May 19. In that report FDA officials said environmental samples collected in another Pasco, WA, food processing plant matched some of the listeriosis victims. Those samples from Oregon Potato Co. led that company to recall onion products from its wholesale customers and resulted in at least one so-called downstream, or secondary, recall by one of those customers -- the Pictsweet Co. -- of consumer products.

Recommendations for turkey safetyThe CDC posted tips for consumers with the outbreak announcement: Watch for symptomsAnyone can become sick with a Salmonella infection, but infants, children, seniors and people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of serious illness because their immune systems are fragile, according to the CDC. Anyone who has eaten any of the recalled products and developed symptoms of Salmonella infection should seek medical attention. Sick people should tell their doctors about the possible exposure to Salmonella bacteria because special tests are necessary to diagnose salmonellosis. Salmonella infection symptoms can mimic other illnesses, frequently leading to misdiagnosis. Symptoms of Salmonella infection can include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating contaminated food. Otherwise healthy adults are usually sick for four to seven days. In some cases, however, diarrhea may be so severe that patients need to be hospitalized.  Older adults, children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients, are more likely to develop severe illness and serious, sometimes life-threatening conditions.

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health asked the public to not consume raw freshwater fish or aquatic products, and to handle such items with caution to avoid contact with wounds, including small cuts and scratches. This past week, the Hospital Authority, an agency that manages public hospitals, told the CHP that 88 patients had tested positive for invasive Group B Streptococcus (GBS) in September and October, and provided specimens of 68 patients for genetic sequencing analysis. This has shown that, amongst the 68 patients, 32 of them belonged to a variety of sequence type 283 (ST283), 27 cases are other serotypes or another strain of ST283, while the results for the remaining nine cases are pending. Ongoing investigationNormal levels have ranged from nine to 26 cases per month in the past three years from January 2019 to August 2021. The CHP's epidemiological investigations show the 32 ST283 cases likely have the same source of infection. Patients are 14 males and 18 females with ages ranging from 31 to 87 years old living in various districts. Half of them reported a history of handling freshwater fish and some handled raw freshwater fish, such as grass carp, with hand wounds. None reported consuming raw freshwater fish. Three of them are cooks in restaurants and one is a part-time fishmonger. According to information from the Hospital Authority, two people have died, but the cause of death was not clear, and 10 have been discharged from hospitals CHP has collected fish and environmental samples in markets visited by some cases and confirmed the genetic sequencing of these samples is identical to those of the 32 ST283 patients. The agency believes that handling raw freshwater fish with hand wounds may be associated with infection but did not exclude the risk from consumption of undercooked freshwater fish. In Hong Kong, the sale of freshwater fish sashimi is prohibited. The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department has been carrying out cleaning and disinfection of the markets concerned. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department is taking more fish samples from the freshwater fish wholesale markets to get an idea of the local situation. Past outbreak in SingaporeA CHP spokesman said Group B Streptococcus is found in 20 to 40 percent of healthy adults but also causes severe infections among the elderly and vulnerable people. ""The sources of invasive Group B Streptococcal infection are mostly unclear. Literature also reported that it relates to eating or improper handling of contaminated food, and some even reported that invasive Group B Streptococcus of ST283 exists in freshwater fish, especially cultured fish,"" he said. ""In 2015, there were a number of cases of Group B Streptococcus of ST283 involving 146 people in Singapore who had consumed raw freshwater fish. Thereafter, presence of Group B Streptococcus of ST283 was also reported in freshwater fish in other Southeast Asia countries including Thailand and Vietnam."" Epidemiological investigations showed there was a strong link with consuming raw freshwater fish including raw Asian bighead carp and snakehead. This led to a ban on the use of raw freshwater fish in all ready-to-eat raw fish dishes in Singapore since December 2015. Nearly 20 infections were also identified in Singapore in July 2020 but the source was not found. To minimize infection risks, the CHP advised fish and restaurant workers to wear gloves when handling aquatic products and avoid direct contact with such items or dirty water with bare hands. When buying fish from markets, the public must not touch the fish. They should wash hands with liquid soap and water as soon as possible if they had contact with raw aquatic products. When handling these products at home, people should wear gloves and wash hands thoroughly afterwards.

However, health officials in the City of Brotherly Love are not yet ready to name any specific restaurants that may be associated with the outbreak. The 14 E. coli patients all became ill since Aug. 30. The 14 range in age from 7 to 90 years old.

""It is important that health official link the illnesses to a specific food item as quickly as possible, so a recall can occur to limit the spread of the E. coli bacteria,"" added Marler. The city health officials said the illnesses were due to one of five Shiga-toxin E. coli strains. Symptoms often begin with non-bloody diarrhea, which develops in two to three days into bloody diarrhea. Severe abdominal pain and fever may follow. People often are exposed to E. coli bacteria by consuming contaminated food and beverage products or through contact with an infected person. Recent outbreaks are associated with beef and leafy greens along with direct contact with animals. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), a dangerous disease involving blood vessels in the kidneys. It can cause acute renal dysfunction. HUS frequently develops from E. coli infections, most often in children under the age of five. Philadelphia's E. coli outbreak comes on the heels of the city's month-old public health emergency for Hepatitis A. The hepatitis emergency was declared after city health officials counted 154 acute hepatitis A infections through Aug. 1 with the investigation of several other reports underway. Hepatitis A is usually spread when the virus enters the body through the mouth from contact with objects, food, or drinks that have been contaminated by the feces (poop) of an infected person. Since the summer of 2018, the city Health Department has conducted extensive outreach to raise awareness and provide hepatitis A vaccine and personal hygiene items to high-risk populations and potentially exposed persons living in neighborhoods with increased disease burden. The Health Department has also been working with Prevention Point Philadelphia, homeless shelters, hospital emergency departments, the Philadelphia Department of Prisons, and other City agencies who serve at-risk populations to expand outreach, promote vaccination, and increase the Department's access to these high-risk groups, and has conducted street outreach to interact with these populations to directly offer hepatitis A vaccine. The Health Department has also issued six health alerts since the Fall of 2017 to the health care community to raise awareness about national and local increases and provide instructions on how to recognize and prevent infection. The department has been providing free vaccinations at designated locations throughout the city.  The health officials say the best way to prevent hepatitis A is through vaccination. Frequent handwashing with soap and warm water after using the bathroom, changing a diaper, or before preparing food can help prevent the spread of hepatitis A.

Acre decided to initiate the recall after at least 22 illnesses on the East Coast were traced back to its egg production farm in Hyde County, North Carolina, which produces 2.3 million eggs a day from 3 million laying hens.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is involved in an investigation that has included an inspection of the facility and interviews of the victims. Healthy individuals infected with SalmonellaBraenderup can experience fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella Braenderup can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. The potentially contaminated eggs from the Hyde County farm reached consumers in ten states including Colorado, Florida, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia by direct delivery to retail stores and restaurants. More than 550 million table eggs were called from two Iowa egg farms owned by Austin (Jack) DeCoster in 2010 involving a nationwide  Salmonella outbreak that sickened thousands.   Afterward, Jack and his son Peter DeCoster each plead guilty to one count of allowing misbranded and adultered food to enter interstate commerce.   They and their company, Quality Egg LLC, ended up paying $7 million in fines and both DeCosters served three months in federal prison. The affected eggs this time are  from plant number P-1065 with the Julian date range of 011 through the date of 102 printed on either the side portion or the principal side of the carton or package, as follows: Lot Codes 011 - 102 (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

Some say the big question is whether the chicken or the egg came first, but public health pros say a more important question is whether you know the food safety do's and don'ts involved with backyard flocks. In 2017, live poultry was responsible for 10 Salmonella outbreaks in the United States, sickening more than 1,100 people across 48 states and killing one. ""Contact with live poultry or their environment can make people sick with Salmonella infections. Live poultry can be carrying Salmonella bacteria but appear healthy and clean, with no sign of illness,"" according to the a warning from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People planning backyard flocks usually buy chicks in February. After six weeks they are moved from their indoor heat lamp environments to outdoor coops. Most farm stores know the importance of encouraging handwashing after handling chicks in order to avoid issues of cross-contamination from hands. Furthermore, the CDC recommends always washing hands thoroughly with soap and water right after touching anything in the area where live birds live and roam. Adults should always supervise handwashing for children. Poultry should not be allowed to live or roam inside the house, and children younger than 5 years old should not be allowed to handle or touch chicks, ducklings, or other live poultry without constant adult observation. This chick season, remember to monitor for symptoms of Salmonella infection. Anyone that is exposed to backyard poultry and develops symptoms of Salmonella should seek medical attention and tell their doctors about the possible exposure so the proper diagnostic tests can be performed. Symptoms for most people can include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps, beginning 12 to 72 hours after exposure to the bacteria. Illness from Salmonella usually lasts four to seven days. In some people, the diarrhea may be so severe that the person needs to be hospitalized. Salmonella infections are more likely to be severe for children younger than 5 years, older adults and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with cancer, diabetes, and liver or kidney disease.

",N/A,N/A,N/A,Salmonella infection,1,United States2263,"Phyllis Entis's new book ""Tainted"" shows readers that when it comes to food safety, conventional wisdom isn't always enough. As Entis puts it, ""the food preparation skills we learned from our parents and grandparents are no longer good enough to keep us safe."" Whether it's Salmonella in eggs, listeria in deli meats, melamine in milk or Cyclospora in lettuce, ""Tainted"" illustrates that everyone has a responsibility to ensure that the food we eat is as safe as we can make it. Entis shows that everyone -- government regulators, farmers, ranchers, food processors, food service workers, retailers, educators and consumers -- are needed to accomplish this herculean task. Phyllis Entis is a retired food safety microbiologist. ""Tainted"" is the update of her 2007 book, ""Food Safety: Old Habits, New Perspectives."" The original version had an academic bent, but ""Tainted"" is more in line with Entis's original vision of making food safety accessible to the lay reader. In recent years, Entis has honed her storytelling abilities as she has been working as a mystery writer. She is known for the Damien Dickens Mysteries series, which includes ""The Green Pearl Caper,"" ""The White Russian Caper,"" ""The Chocolate Labradoodle Caper,"" ""The Gold Dragon Caper,"" and ""The Blue Moon Caper."" Her debut novel, ""The Green Pearl Caper,"" was a Library Journal SELF-e Selection. Writing mystery novels prepared her well to write ""Tainted,"" as food safety illnesses often function as mysteries. ""Tainted"" often reads like a true crime novel, where laymen and authorities uncover clues to save the public from future poisonings and reveal the culprits of past poisonings. After reading ""Tainted"", I asked Entis if she has a particular story from the novel that she finds most memorable. She pointed to the Regent Chocolate episode. In January 1974, a Salmonella Eastbourne outbreak was linked to Regent Chocolate. Entis's lab with Canada's Health Protection Branch was responsible for checking all of the suspect chocolate stored in warehouses in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. ""I am a chocoholic and it was torture to be surrounded by all those giant Easter bunnies and chocolate Christmas tree ornaments and not be able to nibble."" Entis was able to watch Regent's response firsthand and see how effective the company's approach and changes were. She explains in the book how Regent could serve as a model for how companies can learn from their mistakes. Though ""Tainted"" is a great book for those interested in learning more about food safety, it's also a book for those who simply want to be entertained by the drama behind the scenes of food safety. If you read ""Tainted"" and have been spurred to read more about food safety, Entis recommends Nicols Fox's 1997 book, ""Spoiled, The Dangerous Truth About a Food Chain Gone Haywire,"" Jeff Benedict's ""Poisoned,"" and Deborah Blum's ""The Poison Squad."" ""Tainted"" was released Dec. 2 and can be ordered now on Amazon.  Entis's book reached  No. 1 overall in the Microbiology category on Amazon during the first week of its release.

During October and November 2016, more than 1,000 customers and staff reported gastroenteritis after eating at 23 different locations of the Wahaca restaurant group in the U.K. Norovirus genogroup II.6 (GII.6) was identified from 30 of 48 samples from staff. The outbreak coincided with a new menu launch, according to the study published in the journal Eurosurveillance. ""We recommend that multi-branch restaurants with central suppliers and kitchens are vigilant to the possibility of contaminated ingredients entering their supply chain and the potential for rapid spread of pathogens. Food business operators should ensure that appropriate hazard analysis and critical control point processes are in place, particularly for new ingredients and ready-to-eat foods and consider the potential for cross-contamination within preparation areas in risk assessments,"" the researchers wrote. Product from outside the EUInvolvement of all 23 branches suggested the vehicle of transmission was a nationally distributed item that had either been newly introduced or modified for use in the new menu. The most likely vehicle was found to be a new chipotle chili product imported from outside the European Union that was used uncooked in implicated dishes. Public health implications could have been more serious had the outbreak been caused by a more virulent pathogen than norovirus, which is generally a mild and self-limiting illness, according to the researchers. The likely source was a contaminated batch of a nationally distributed ingredient, but analytical studies were unable to implicate a single ingredient. The investigation highlighted challenges in identifying the vehicle of transmission from a large, complex menu with multiple ingredients used in numerous dishes with possible undocumented variation between restaurant locations. Environmental health investigations identified one chipotle product which had been labelled as another chipotle product in some locations. ""It had been newly imported from outside the European Union for the new menu, was not tinned and was not cooked during initial processing. It is plausible that chipotle product B may have been mistakenly used in the chipotle mayo in place of chipotle product A in some branches and this may explain the variation in attack rate,"" according to researchers. Illnesses after new menu launchOn Oct. 27, 2016, Public Health England (PHE) received reports of diarrhea and vomiting affecting 10 staff at a London location of the restaurant chain. In the following days, customers from all branches and staff members from 22 sites reported gastrointestinal symptoms to the company's head office. The day before, a new menu was introduced at all branches with more than 70 dishes, 12 of which had never been served before. In total, 287 staff members and 825 customers reported gastrointestinal illness to the company. The first report of illness on Oct. 19 was in a staff member and the last recorded illness onset date was Nov. 11. Customers first reported illnesses following consumption of food at one branch on Oct. 15 and the last consumer to report an illness dined on Nov. 10. Four retrospective cohort studies were conducted, one among staff of the restaurant group and three in customers at four locations. Staff and customer casesFifty-eight percent (589 out of 1,029) of staff completed the questionnaire, of whom 125 were categorized as cases. The age range was 16 to 55 years, with 57 percent  of the patients being female. Of 159 customer responses in the combined customer cohort study, 37 were male with ages ranging from 7 to 65 years. There were 58 confirmed customer cases. The chipotle chili was the only ingredient in common between two dishes implicated in the multivariable analysis of the staff cohort study and one dish implicated by the combined customer study. Recipes for salmon and chicken tostadas included chipotle mayo. The recipe for chicken wing glaze included a chipotle chili paste. All dishes associated with gastrointestinal illness in the multivariable analysis were prepared in the salad section, meaning cross-contamination could have played a role in transmission, researchers reported. Customer cohort studies found a strong association between gastrointestinal illness and consumption of dishes containing poached, ready-to-eat, vacuum-packed chicken from a new supplier, introduced for the menu change. Food chain investigations found no evidence to implicate chicken as a vehicle for norovirus transmission and it was supplied to other U.K. restaurants, but there were no reports of similar outbreaks or of gastrointestinal illness from staff responsible for processing it. Wahaca voluntarily closed 16 of its locations in the U.K. and discarded fresh and partially used produce. Those restaurants carried out deep cleaning, including environmental fogging. Staff were advised to stay off work for 72 hours following their last gastrointestinal symptoms and were offered paid sick leave to encourage policy adherence. Potential vehicles of norovirus transmission identified by epidemiological studies were removed from the menu. Researchers were unable to test the potential vehicles identified for norovirus, because accredited methods are only available for limited food items, not implicated in the outbreak. The team said development of sensitive laboratory methods for testing food specimens for viruses during outbreaks would be valuable in future investigations.

He established a website in 2009 for people to report their experiences of being sickened by restaurant food. ""The one where I had the idea to do it was a deli BLT,"" he told Food Safety News. ""It was one of those things where you call them and they're like, 'It wasn't us, bye,' and you do feel helpless. And maybe it wasn't them. You're kind of at a loose end at that point."" His site, Iwaspoisoned.com, has now logged more than 30,000 reports of foodborne illness from individuals across the country naming restaurants, locations, symptoms, and other details, such as what the person ate, how they felt, and for how long. There's also a way for people to comment on each report. An incident posted Sept. 1 noted that someone in CA had become ill after eating a locally sourced meal: ""I ate boiled new potatoes from Davis Coop, broccoli from UCD farmers market, grass fed organic cheddar cheese from a Trader Joes, and Kerry Gold unsalted butter. Two hours later I had nausea and vomited it all up. Also some diarrhea around same time."" Another person, this one from FL, reported eating at a McDonald's on Sept. 1: ""Got there bacon mcdouble cheeseburger. My whole family had to be admitted that night. We all got deathly sick. It was horrible. Will not EVER eat there again."" A visitor to the site can't access the entire record of reported incidents going back to 2009, mainly because Quade thinks it's unnecessary and could be unfair. ""I don't want it to become like a witch hunt and see one company's whole history. I don't want to point fingers and stuff like that,"" he says. ""The other thing is there's some really damning intel in that data that makes some restaurants look really bad compared to other restaurants, and I don't want someone extracting data and compiling it and making some restaurant look terrible when maybe there's some other factors."" For example, he notes that there could be one geographic area with more iPhone users or more tech-savvy people who can more easily generate foodborne illness incident reports. So far, Quade has noticed that some restaurants show up more often in the reports than others. ""There are some huge outliers out there and some better than you would think,"" he says, adding that foodborne illnesses appear to be dispersed around the country and not centered in any particular regions. However, when he's looked at the reporting per capita and grouped the incidents into chain-owned restaurants compared to mostly company-owned restaurants, one trend is clear: The company-owned outlets have more foodborne illness problems. Quade can only guess why, but he suspects that having on-site managers hiring and supervising local employees might affect the situation. The site played a role in the recent outbreak linked to a Chipotle restaurant in Simi Valley, CA. According to an Aug. 22, 2015, CBS News report from Los Angeles, more than a dozen people posted the same symptoms there after eating at the same restaurant on the same day. Quade is clear that he doesn't know whether all the foodborne illness information that people submit to his site is accurate, but he posts a disclaimer noting that fact. He also states that people may report a foodborne illness when, in fact, it's actually something else. ""Is my data perfect? No. That's why I cut the data off,"" he says. ""If there's 100 reports from one place, is that unusual? Maybe someone should take a look."" He says that he gets visits and occasional comments from public health officials and some restaurants. Plans for the site include comparative analyses and benchmark reports from the data for restaurants interested in what people are saying about their fare. ""I've offered it to one place, but I didn't hear back. I have put an end user together with the restaurant, and they sent that person a letter,"" he recalls. ""As the site hopefully gets bigger and hopefully a force, I'd like to do more comparison charts."" Quade says that launching the site hasn't changed his eating habits much but has made him more aware of the dimensions of the foodborne illness problem in the U.S., which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates affects 48 million (roughly 1 in 6) people every year. That number may not be an accurate estimate, he says, making information gathered on his site, and the prospect of followup action, even more critical. ""I think it's a lot more than 50 million or even 70 million a year,"" Quade says. ""If you can reduce that by even 10 percent, it's enormous.""

Between March and May, four suspected foodborne outbreaks were reported, compared with an average of 18 in previous years, according to the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL). The agency believes this is because of the coronavirus pandemic and associated limitations and recommendations. When hands are washed diligently and food is prepared for smaller groups, there are fewer epidemics, the THL reported. Suspected pathogens in the four outbreaks are Campylobacter, Yersinia, and norovirus. Ruska Rimhanen-Finne, an epidemiologist at THL, said as summer comes, cooking and eating out will increase. ""The most important way to avoid food poisoning also applies in summer: always wash your hands thoroughly before cooking and eating. Also remember to wash vegetables, cook meat and take care of good food handling and storage practices."" A common pictureMore than 130 foodborne outbreaks were recorded in Finland between 2014 and 2016, according to an earlier report published in 2019. Norovirus remained the most common agent and was responsible for 42 outbreaks. There was one Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and five Campylobacter outbreaks reported in that period. The picture in Finland reflects reports elsewhere. Rates of Campylobacter and Salmonella infections in Australia have fallen since a lockdown was imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Experts in the United Kingdom and Ireland urged caution in interpreting a decline in foodborne illness figures during the coronavirus outbreak as an actual drop in infections while a Dutch report found people are paying more attention to hygiene in the kitchen. Researchers at the National Food Institute in Denmark are testing a hypothesis that Danes' increased focus on hand hygiene and changes in what they eat and who prepares the food will lead to a decrease in foodborne illness cases.

Of 48 ill people with information available,  six hospitalizations were reported. No deaths were reported. Five illness clusters were identified at restaurants serving ramen in three states. Ten (91 percent) of the 11 ill people linked to restaurant clusters reported eating wood ear mushrooms or ramen containing wood ear mushrooms in the week before their illness started. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  and states conducted a traceback investigation from four of the restaurants with illness clusters to identify the source of the wood ear mushrooms eaten by ill people. Traceback determined that Wismettac Asian Foods  Inc., supplied wood ear mushrooms (dried fungus) to these restaurants. Wismettac Asian Foods on Sept. 23, 2020, recalled dried fungus due to possible Salmonella contamination., The California Department of Public Health ion Oct. 1, 2020, identified the outbreak strain of Salmonella Stanley in recalled dried fungus samples.

The company reported distributing the implicated 5-pound bags of flour nationwide. UNFI did not report what company milled the flour. Consumers who have purchased 5-pound packages of ""Wild Harvest Organic All-Purpose Flour, Unbleached"" are urged to discard it if it has a Code of AA BEST IF USED BY 010820 CC 15:58 and UPC Code 711535509158, according to the company's notice posted by the Food and Drug Administration. If consumers have Wild Harvest organic flour that is not in its original packaging, they should throw it out. Any containers used to hold the recalled flour should be throughly washed. Any consumers concerned about an illness should contact a physician. ""To date, UNFI has not received any direct consumer reports of confirmed illnesses related to this product,"" according to the recall notice. About E. coli inffectionsAnyone who has eaten any of the implicated product and developed symptoms of E. coli infection should seek medical attention and tell their doctor about their possible exposure to the bacteria. Specific tests are required to diagnose the infections, which can mimic other illnesses. The symptoms of E. coli infections vary for each person but often include severe stomach cramps and diarrhea, which is often bloody. Some patients may also have a fever. Most patients recover within five to seven days. Others can develop severe or life-threatening symptoms and complications, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). About 5 to 10 percent of those diagnosed with E. coli infections develop a potentially life-threatening kidney failure complication, known as a hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Symptoms of HUS include fever, abdominal pain, feeling very tired, decreased frequency of urination, small unexplained bruises or bleeding, and pallor. Many people with HUS recover within a few weeks, but some suffer permanent injuries or death. This condition can occur among people of any age but is most common in children younger than five years old because of their immature immune systems, older adults because of deteriorating immune systems, and people with compromised immune systems such as cancer patients. People who experience HUS symptoms should immediately seek emergency medical care. People with HUS will likely be hospitalized because the condition can cause other serious and ongoing problems such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, brain damage, and neurologic problems.

Another eight people who also ate at the cafe became sick with what authorities suspect is salmonellosis, according to the Elkhart Logan Valley Public Health Department. The department is seeking the public's help to find the source of the bacteria. ""So far, all confirmed cases have one common factor, which is dining at Red Door Coffee in West Point,"" according to an update posted by the local health department Thursday. ""Red Door Coffee owners and staff are fully cooperating with the investigation."" The outbreak update did not report dates of illness onset or whether any of the 28 sick people have required hospitalization. Investigators with the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services are assisting local officials, but as of Thursday evening they were not suggesting any suspected root sources of the Salmonella bacteria. ""Anyone who ate at Red Door Coffee July 14-29 is asked to complete a brief survey that will help ELVPHD and DHHS in this investigation,"" according to the local health department notice. ""The survey may be found at: https://han.ne.gov/survey/rdc."" Even people who did not become ill after eating at the restaurant during the second half of July are urged to complete the survey to help eliminate foods as possible sources of the Salmonella bacteria. Red Door Coffee patrons who dined at the cafe recently and became ill should seek medical attention and tell their doctors about the possible exposure to Salmonella so the proper diagnostic tests can be performed. Symptoms of salmonella infection include fever, diarrhea and stomach cramps. The illness usually lasts four to seven days. In some cases the diarrhea may be so severe that a person needs to be hospitalized. People at highest risk for salmonella infection include: children under 5 years old, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. Salmonella is caused by a bacteria that lives in the intestinal tracts of humans and animals, according to public health officials. It is usually spread to humans by eating contaminated food, including beef, poultry, milk, eggs or vegetables. Thorough cooking kills salmonella. Elkhorn Logan Valley Public Health Department first alerted the public to the Salmonella outbreak on Wednesday when there were 15 confirmed cases and six probable cases. The initial outbreak announcement did not name Red Door Coffee. The cafe in West Point, NE, just opened for business this past spring.

Federal officials said today they have identified one grower's romaine as the source of eight of the infections, but a tangled web of supply chain records has significantly slowed their investigation into the other illnesses. The ongoing outbreak is the largest of its kind since the deadly 2006 E. coli outbreak traced to fresh spinach, public health officials said. There are at least two dozen romaine growers who are being reviewed as federal officials work to pinpoint the source of the current outbreak. As of today, there are 98 confirmed cases across 22 states, up from the 84 cases reported Wednesday. All of the victims are infected with the same strain of E. coli O157: H7, and it is a particularly dangerous one, said CDC's Robert Tauxe. Ten of the sick people have developed kidney failure, including three children. More than half of the ill people, 46, have required hospitalization. The illness onset dates range from March 13 to April 20.  The specific bacteria involved is referred to as an ""STX2 only"" form of E. coli O157: H7. It aggressively attacks blood vessels, particularly in the kidneys, digestive system and brain.  No one should eat, serve or sell any form of romaine lettuce ""under any circumstances"" until further notice unless they can confirm is not from the Yuma, AZ, growing region, said Matt Wise, deputy branch chief for Outbreak Response at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That warning is the same that the CDC posted April 20. Initially, only pre-chopped romaine was implicated. Wise said the specific E. coli O157: H7 bacteria causing the illnesses is so dangerous that all people, not just the traditional high-risk groups, should avoid Yuma-grown romaine.  Known and unknownThe CDC knows quite a bit about the confirmed victims, including the fact that 96 percent of those interviewed so far, 67 of 98, reported eating romaine during the week before they got sick. They know that all but eight of the 98 ate pre-chopped romaine from bagged or other packaged mixed salads and at restaurants. The eight who consumed romaine from whole heads are inmates at a prison in Alaska that received the lettuce from Harrison Farm in Yuma, said Stic Harris, director of the FDA's Coordinated Outbreak Response and Evaluation Network. However, inspectors from the Food and Drug Administration have not yet visited the farm and have not been provided details such as the specific location of the field where the implicated romaine was grown. The FDA's and CDC's outbreak specialists discussed the ongoing public health threat involving romaine lettuce during a telephone news conference this afternoon. Other than identifying the Yuma area in general and Harrison Farm in particular, FDA officials answered many of the media's questions today with: ""We don't know yet."" That lack of knowledge is not for a lack of trying, according to FDA's Harris. The current federal law requires entities in the food supply chain to only maintain shipping and receiving records that are referred to as ""one step forward, one step back."" That means every link, from growers to retailers and restaurants, don't have to know where fresh produce ultimately goes or comes from. Consequently, traceability during outbreak and recall investigations requires the FDA to contact each link in the supply chain to work its way back to the source of fresh produce commodities like romaine lettuce. Harris said, ""more descriptive"" labeling would greatly help in traceback situations. Even basic requirements for uniformity of records would help. Some businesses have handwritten records and others have electronic files. Either way, the records are often incomplete.  Many in the fresh produce industry have not implemented the labeling designed by their own industry's Produce Traceability Initiative. A common reason is that the labels would cost more. Questions that remain unanswered as of this afternoon's news conference, many because of the traceability problems, include: Q. Is the outbreak over?A. More cases are expected to be identified because of the lag time of two to three weeks between when a person becomes sick and the time it takes for lab tests, confirmation tests, reporting to local and state officials, and finally reporting to the CDC. There may also be new infections developing from unknown and possible ongoing distribution of Yuma-area romaine. Q. Can you guarantee that the Yuma harvest is finished and no romaine is being shipped from that area?A. No. Industry tells us the Yuma season is over and harvest has moved to California, but we haven't been able to confirm that yet. Q. Are any of the two dozen other growers' fields adjacent to the Harrison Farm romaine field?A. We don't have those records yet. Q. Is there a common irrigation water source for any of the fields?A. We don't have those records yet. Q. What is the specific location of the Harrison Farm field that is implicated?A. We don't have that information yet. Q. Is Harrison Farm growing or shipping any other fresh produce or more romaine?A. The FDA does not have any information at this point to suggest that any other produce in involved. Harrison Farm is currently growing grass in its romaine field. Q. Are there any common processors or shippers among the other farms you are investigating?A. We haven't received all of those records yet. We are looking at all points in the supply chain, from growers to the restaurants and retailers, as is the practice for all outbreak investigations.

They released their new plan today with many steps repeating their walk thus far, but new footprints are planned to leave the mark of improved food safety. Announced in a Voices Blog entry from the Food and Drug Administration, the commissioner and deputy commissioner of the agency joined forces to point at obvious environmental problems with leafy greens production. They had a laser focus on romaine lettuce, partly because of five E. coli O157: H7 traced to it from 2017 through 2019. ""The plan is a mix of all the work going on as well as new efforts,"" FDA's Deputy Commissioner for Food Policy and Response Frank Yiannas told Food Safety News this afternoon.  Yiannas said one area of increased focus is the review of the impact that animal agriculture has on the contamination of fresh produce growing fields. Regardless of whether major corporate feedlot operations are involved -- such as the ones on Yuma, AZ, that have been associated with outbreaks -- or small family operations with one irrigation pond, animal feces provide pathogen sources for water runoff and dust particles. Hand in hand with concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) is the question of irrigation water, Yiannas said. Toward that FDA officials plan to publish a new federal rule for agriculture water standards by the end of this year. The rulemaking process after publication in the Federal Register can take years, but not if an item is fast-tracked. The ag water rule is already overdue, with the new deadline 2022. A third key element that is new to FDA's leafy greens response, Yiannas said, is closer scrutiny of third-party audit companies that food producers use to gain food safety certification. ""We are already working with third-party auditing firms to let them know they are not doing a good job and we have already made progress,"" Yiannas told Food Safety News. The FDA's 2020 plan does not include any specific enforcement measures against third-party auditors that are found to be failing to accurately review food safety practices at food businesses. One roadblock that had to be overcome on FDA's road to its new plan was the noise of information overload. Yiannas said sorting through the noise of duplicated data and missing pieces of key information was incredibly time-consuming. Information from states, academia, and other federal agencies flooded FDA sub-agencies and departments.  But, digging through the data has given the agency a clearer picture of the problems that need to be resolved. Romaine is one of those problems cited throughout the 2,400-word plan.  ""This produce commodity has been too often implicated in outbreaks of foodborne illness. These include recurring outbreaks of E. coli O157: H7 infections tied to consumption of romaine lettuce, which is very popular in this country,"" said FDA Commissioner of Food and Drugs Stephen Hahn today. As far as recent romaine outbreaks, Yiannas said part of the 2020 plan is to release investigation information that has previously been withheld from the pubic. The reporting is listed under the response category in the plan. "". . . we will soon be publishing an investigation report on three outbreaks of E. coli O157: H7 infections tied to romaine lettuce and leafy greens between November and December 2019. Each was tied to the Salinas Valley in California. We will also be conducting follow-up surveillance of fields in that region during this fall's growing/harvest season,"" Yiannas said. ""As public health officials, we are concerned by these recurring outbreaks and we believe all involved with the production and sale of fresh leafy greens can do better."" BackgroundSince 2017 a string of E. coli O157H:7 outbreaks across the U.S. and Canada have sickened more than 500 people and been linked to leafy greens grown in the U.S. Of the confirmed patients nearly 200 were so sick they had to be admitted to hospitals. Fifty of the patients developed acute kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). There were seven reported deaths.  ""Food safety is a shared responsibility that involves food producers, distributors, manufacturers, retailers, and regulators. We've previously called on the leafy green industry to do more, and meeting our own responsibility involves collaboration with state partners on education, training, and inspections,"" said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn.  ""This plan is designed to help foster a more urgent, collaborative and action-oriented approach."" Some of the produce industry has responded partly by increasing the distance between massive feedlot operations and open leafy green growing fields. The fields are irrigated with water from open canals adjacent to the 100,000 head feedlots. Some new water considerations continue to be reviewed. The California and Arizona Leafy Greens Marketing Agreement organizations are also involved in research that they say they have been conducting since 2017. Members of the organizations agree to abide by a set of self-imposed regulations that are audited by state inspectors. The following are some of the highlights from the FDA's leafy greens plan. To read the entire plan, click here. Advance Agricultural Water Safety In recent outbreaks associated with romaine lettuce consumption, the microbial contamination of agricultural water was identified as a potential contributing factor. 2020 Actions: Enhance Inspection, Auditing, and Certification Programs Recent leafy greens outbreaks have revealed gaps in audit standards and certification programs that need bolstering in order to maximize their effectiveness as food safety verification tools.  2020 Actions: Buyer Specifications Retail and foodservice produce buyers can play an important role in ensuring the safety of leafy greens. Some buyers have begun to strengthen their food safety specifications for purchasing leafy greens. 2020 Action: Leafy Green Data Trust With the food industry becoming increasingly digital and new data streams arising from advances in technology, it is more important than ever that there be mechanisms for data to be shared by government and industry to avoid duplication of efforts and to inform prevention with the most robust data sets available. 2020 Action: Microbiological Surveys for STEC Detection and Enhanced Sampling Protocols:  FDA is conducting assignments to test samples of romaine lettuce grown in the Central Coast, Central Valley, and Imperial Valley in California and in Yuma, Arizona, for pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella to support prevention efforts. 2020 Actions: Increase Awareness and Address Concerns Around Adjacent and Nearby Land Use: Adjacent and nearby land use, particularly land use involving livestock production, has the potential to be a source of pathogens, especially STEC, that can contaminate produce. More focus and work are needed to better understand how to evaluate and mitigate potential hazards. 2020 Action: Publish Salinas Outbreak Investigation Report Between November and December 2019, FDA and multiple state and federal partners were involved in the investigation of three outbreak investigations related to three separate E. coli O157:H7 strains and the consumption of romaine lettuce or leafy greens. It is important to share further information about the investigation approach and factors that potentially contributed to the contamination. Conduct Follow-Up Surveillance During the Fall 2020 California Growing/Harvest Season Leafy greens grown in the Salinas Valley of California have been associated with several recent outbreaks of pathogenic STEC. FDA and state partners conducted on-farm investigations in late 2019 to identify factors that may have contributed to the outbreaks. Traceback investigations have identified farms that may have supplied contaminated products. Maintaining surveillance efforts during the 2020 growing/harvest season on these farms may enhance the ability of FDA and government partners to prevent future contamination. Promote Tech-Enabled Traceability Public health agencies have gotten better at detecting foodborne illnesses, but our ability to trace back to the source of contaminated foods has been hampered, in part, by the lack of modernized food traceability capabilities. Achieving end-to-end traceability throughout the leafy greens supply chain could make it possible to rapidly trace a contaminated food to its source, which can help shorten outbreaks, narrow product warnings, and prevent illnesses. Improve Utilization of Shopper Card Data Point-of-purchase recordkeeping, such as shopper cards, can improve the speed and accuracy of traceback investigations by helping retail facilities determine what specific products were purchased and may have been consumed.  However, more work is needed to streamline the process for gathering these data. Accelerate Whole Genome Sequencing Data Submission by States Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) reveals the complete DNA make-up of an organism. We use this technology to determine the relatedness among foodborne pathogens and clinical cases during foodborne illness outbreaks. WGS also facilitates the identification of illnesses that may be part of an outbreak, as well as any links to food or environmental samples. Ensuring that samples are processed and reported in an expedited fashion is critical for efficient outbreak investigations. Advanced Root Cause Analysis Activities The repeat nature of STEC outbreaks in leafy greens illustrates the importance of root cause analyses to characterize how the contamination took place, inform what preventive measures are needed, and prevent future outbreaks. New models for conducting root cause analyses may increase the effectiveness of these tools. Enhance Outbreak and Recall Communications Communications during outbreaks are essential for spurring swift industry action and notifying consumers of potentially contaminated products.  In addition, outbreak communications are important for informing industry of ongoing food safety issues within the leafy greens sector.  Continuous improvements are needed to ensure that communication during outbreaks and recalls is effective in reaching all industry and consumer stakeholders.

The number of confirmed people sick stands at more than 20 in six federal states which is up from the six mentioned in a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) assessment in February. At that time, 193 cases of a certain sequence type of Salmonella Enteritidis had also been reported in Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (UK) between May 2018 and December 2020. Another sequence type of Salmonella Enteritidis has sickened about 300 people in the UK. One person from Canada with a travel history to Europe was ill in 2019. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has warned people three times about breaded chicken linked to Salmonella infections and issued consumer advice. Earlier this month, Grzegorz Puda, Polish minister of Agriculture and Forestry, spoke with George Eustice, secretary of state for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs about the problem. Frozen breaded chicken products traced to different meat suppliers, slaughterhouses, and farms in Poland have tested positive for Salmonella Enteritidis matching the outbreak strain. More cooking at home during CoronavirusThe Robert Koch Institute (RKI), German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) and Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL) are investigating the outbreak in Germany. The BfR said as a result of measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, people are increasingly cooking at home and more convenient products such as frozen food are being used. The agency added it is not always immediately apparent whether such products contain pre-cooked or raw meat. Official food control data from 2018 shows that Salmonella was found in 5.6 percent of the chicken meat samples examined and Campylobacter in every second sample. Salmonella is killed during the cooking of poultry meat if a high enough temperature is reached. However, it can be transferred to hands, household appliances and kitchen surfaces, and other foods can be contaminated. Advice includes storing and preparing raw poultry products and other foods separately, carefully disposing of packaging materials, not washing the chicken, washing hands thoroughly with warm water and soap between the individual preparation steps and clean equipment and surfaces that have come into contact with raw poultry products before using them again.

Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) is usually associated with travel diarrhea but the patients in the current outbreak have not been abroad, which suggests a common food may have made people sick, according to the Statens Serum Institut (SSI). Between Nov. 23 and Dec. 16, 63 infected people with EIEC or ipaH-positive were registered at the Statens Serum Institut and 18 of them have been hospitalized. EIEC was isolated from 22 patients and the remaining 41 are PCR positive for the invasion plasmid antigen H (ipaH) gene, which is specific to Shigella species and EIEC. Patients live all over the country, and there are 43 women and 20 men sick. They are aged from 1 to 91 years old with a median age of 53. Hovedstaden has the most cases with 23, Sjaelland has 19, Midtjylland has 14 and seven live in Syddanmark. The Statens Serum Institut, Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (Fodevarestyrelsen) and DTU Food Institute are trying to find the source of infection. About EIECEIEC can cause intestinal infections and is typically seen among travelers. It is closely related to Shigella. EIEC is transmitted from person to person or through drinking and bathing water as well as foods contaminated with human or animal feces. Microscopic amounts of feces can cause illnesses. The time between being infected and symptoms occurring is typically one to three days. Infection can cause diarrhea, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting or a fever lasting several days and usually goes away on its own. Plenty of fluids are important to prevent and treat dehydration related to diarrhea and vomiting. In case of severe diarrheal disease, consult a doctor. EIEC primarily infects children in the developing world. There is no formal surveillance system for diarrheagenic E. coli and most laboratories are unable to identify them, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 2018, the first confirmed U.S. outbreak of EIEC was found since 1971. More than 50 people were sick after a potluck party in North Carolina, but the source was not clear. Contaminated vegetables were implicated in outbreaks in Italy in 2012 and the United Kingdom in 2014. Leafy greens were linked to an outbreak in Sweden in 2017 with 83 sick.

The report looks at the most recent romaine E. coli outbreak, which was declared over on Jan. 9 after confirmation of 62 illnesses in 16 states and the District of Columbia, resulting in 25 hospitalizations and two cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). There were no deaths. Among the report's findings are: Reaction to the new report included a joint statement from Michael Taylor and Lauren Bush, Co-Chairs of the Stop Foodborne Illness Board. ""Stop Foodborne Illness appreciates FDA's effort to promptly investigate the root cause of the recent outbreak of illness associated with romaine lettuce from California, as well as the agency's issuance of advice to industry on measures that could help prevent future outbreaks,"" the Taylor-Bush statement says. ""This is a critical element of FDA's public health mission, and consumers expect both FDA and industry to take every step possible as soon as possible to learn from past mistakes to prevent future illnesses."" FDA Commissioner Gottlieb and Deputy Commissioner Yiannas said the agency acted quickly to protect consumers by issuing a public health warning ahead of Thanksgiving last year. At that time, the FDA and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta were finding the genetic fingerprint for the most recent pathogen was similar to those recorded in an earlier 2017 outbreak of E. coli O157: H7. The traceback investigation focused on several farms, and the FDA brass credited CDC with being able to ""find one positive match to the outbreak strain of an on-farm water reservoir, used for irrigation, in Santa Maria, CA."" ""The investigation teams made numerous visits to leafy greens farms in various counties and growing regions of California identified through traceback, "" the statement from Gottlieb and Yiannas says. ""The outbreak strain of E. coli O157: H7 was not detected in any other samples collected during this investigation."" The farm with the water that was positive for O157: H7 issued a recall for romaine, red and green lettuce and cauliflower last Dec. 17 because the product might have been contaminated by the use of the water from an on-farm reservoir. ""As part of our investigation, we determined that the farm had a procedure in place to collect and test reservoir agricultural water for generic E. coli and to treat the agricultural water with a sanitizer before use,"" the Gottlieb and Yiannas statement continues. ""However, the investigation team noted the verification procedure records did not document that sufficient sanitizer was present to adequately reduce any pathogens present in the water when this water was used for direct contact with romaine lettuce at harvest, during postharvest handling, and to wash/rinse harvest equipment food contact surfaces. It's important to note that the farm reported that it did not use water from the reservoir for the dilution of crop protection chemicals. It also remains uncertain how the outbreak strain of E. coli O157: H7 was introduced into their on-farm water reservoir. ""The finding of the outbreak strain in the sediment of the water reservoir is significant, as studies have shown that generic E. coli can survive in sediments much longer than in the overlying water. It's possible that the outbreak strain may have been present in the on-farm water reservoir for some months or even years before the investigation team collected the positive sample. It is also possible that the outbreak strain may have been repeatedly introduced into the reservoir from an unknown source. ""The teams did find evidence of extensive wild animal activity, including waterfowl, rodents, coyotes, etc., and animal burrows near the contaminated reservoir. This likely warrants consideration as a possible source of the human pathogen found in the on-farm water reservoir. It is another factor that we will work with the farm to address. Additionally, adjacent land use including the use of soil amendments, or for animal grazing on nearby land, may have had the potential to be contributing factors."" The FDA brass says its important for regulators to understand how leafy greens are grown and harvested; and that buyers and shippers be able to trace products back to the source at any time in the process. Gottlieb and Yiannas said they plan to keep a ""shared sense of urgency"" around these efforts.

The Offerman plant in Aalsmeer was shut in October this past year while Dutch authorities investigated the outbreak. Ter Beke considered renovating the factory but will close the large hall while a smaller one which employs around 40 people will remain open. Some production lines have been moved to different plants while others stayed in Aalsmeer. Company officials said it had no further information to share when contacted by Food Safety News. Outbreak detailsTwenty-one people were infected with Listeria monocytogenes in the Netherlands and Belgium. One person fell sick in October 2017, eight in 2018 and 12 in 2019. Three people died. All patients were hospitalized and one woman had a miscarriage. Two Dutch patients were pregnant women in their 30s. The others ranged in age from 64 to 94 years old and 10 were men. Sliced ready-to-eat (RTE) meat products from boiled and raw sausages from different suppliers produced between 2017 and 2019 by Offerman were contaminated with Listeria that matched the outbreak strain. An assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) could not identify the exact point of contamination but found it likely happened at Offerman, which was the only common manufacturing point of contaminated products. Union actionThe news was revealed by CNV, the second largest union in the Netherlands. It represents a number of workers at the Offerman Aalsmeer plant as well as other Offerman and Ter Beke sites. Soraya Faez, from CNV, said 50 people have lost their jobs at the plant in Aalsmeer but some were offered roles at another Ter Beke site in Ridderkerk. ""The other half could stay in Aalsmeer or were offered a new position at another plant. During negotiations we agreed that the employer could offer workers positions in Ridderkerk but acceptance of that position was to be voluntary. This way a worker could choose not to accept the job in Ridderkerk and keep their severance package,"" she told Food Safety News. Faez added the union knew in October that the plant would not reopen and in the first week of January employees were told whether they could stay in Aalsmeer. ""We now have to wait and see how long the plant in Aalsmeer stays open. We did make sure that the severance package we agreed on would also apply to the workers who work in Aalsmeer at this moment. We did that because there were rumors of the second building also closing."" (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

The vast majority of the infected people -- 44 -- are Virginia residents, according to the Virginia Department of Health and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are also four confirmed victims in Maryland and one each in North Carolina, Oregon and Wisconsin, a CDC spokeswoman said Tuesday. ""CDC, FDA and several states are currently investigating an outbreak of foodborne Hepatitis A linked to frozen strawberries in smoothies served in restaurants,"" the CDC spokeswoman said. ""While Tropical Smoothie Cafe has removed the frozen strawberries from their restaurants and switched to another supplier, we may still see more illnesses due to the long incubation period for Hepatitis A before people start experiencing symptoms. At this time, we do not have information to suggest that there is an ongoing risk of hepatitis A virus infection at Tropical Smoothie Cafes."" That long incubation period, which ranges from 15 to 50 days, is one of the factors that make Hepatitis A outbreaks difficult to investigate, according to state and federal public health officials. Virginia health officials report illness onset dates for the current outbreak range from May through the end of August, but they were not able to connect the dots of their outbreak investigation until early August. Virginia officials notified the Tropical Smoothie Cafe chain at that point, but did not alert the public for another two weeks. ""On Aug. 5 the Virginia Department of Health contacted us about a potential link between Hepatitis A cases and frozen strawberries from Egypt,"" CEO Mike Rotondo says in a YouTube video posted Sunday by Tropical Smoothie Cafe. The restaurant chain immediately removed the implicated fruit from all of its locations, Rotondo says in the video. Tropical Smoothie is now sourcing strawberries from California and Mexico. Virginia delayed public alert for two weeks While pulling the implicated strawberries may have reduced the number of outbreak victims, some Tropical Smoothie customers likely could have been spared infection if Virginia officials had not waited 14 days before alerting the public. That two-week delay is key because of the narrow window of opportunity for post-exposure vaccination. The post-exposure Hepatitis A vaccine, or immune globulin (IG) injections, must be administered within 14 days of exposure or they are not effective, according to Virginia health officials and CDC. ""I think it's important for the Virginia Department of Health and Tropical Smoothie Cafe to say why they didn't alert the public sooner,"" said Bill Marler, a Seattle food safety attorney who is representing outbreak victims. ""By not coming forward they kept people who had been exposed from having the opportunity to protect themselves and their families from Hepatitis A."" An epidemiologist with the Virginia health department said state officials waited because they wanted to gather as much information as possible ""to determine with enough scientific certainty what the risk to the public was so we could understand the risk and communicate it accurately."" ""We did not know for sure where the frozen strawberries were distributed, if the risk was associated with one restaurant chain or more general to other potential sources, if it was limited to Virginia or it extended further. We wanted more information to feel confident that the source was strawberries and not other fruits, especially since smoothies contain so many ingredients,"" said Diane Woolard, director of the health department's division of surveillance and investigation. ""It is important to have a high level of confidence in the message and accuracy in the assessment of risk when issuing statewide notices about a single product."" Woolard said genetic typing data was factored in and evidence continued to point to strawberries that were distributed ""to one restaurant chain."" But even with confirmation from CDC on Aug. 12, Virginia officials waited another week before warning the public. The genetic typing data included in CDC's Aug. 12 report to Virginia showed federal officials had identified a ""genetically identical virus"" in lab samples from multiple sick people ""who reported frozen strawberry consumption from smoothies, confirming that an outbreak was occurring,"" CDC spokeswoman Brittany Behm said Tuesday evening in an email. ""That viral strain is in the same genotype, or family, of strains associated with berries from Egypt in outbreaks that occurred in Europe in the past. The outbreak strain in Virginia is new to our database, and we don't have evidence that the strain matched previously tested food."" That information differs with an Aug. 26 outbreak update posted on the Virginia health department's website. The state officials reported CDC notified them that the specific strain of Hepatitis A that infected the Virginia outbreak victims was the strain ""associated with past outbreaks due to frozen strawberries from Egypt."" CDC was working with Virginia officials Tuesday evening to resolve the confusion and revise the information on the Virginia Department of Health website. Advice for the public Virginia officials continue to urge anyone who had a smoothie at any restaurant in recent weeks to monitor themselves for symptoms of Hepatitis A to help contain the outbreak. ""Approximately 50 percent of the residents, for whom information is available, have been hospitalized for their illness. The 44 ill residents range in age from 15-68. Onsets of illness for the 44 cases range from early May through August,"" the health department reported Tuesday. In its initial warning, the Virginia health department urged anyone who consumed a smoothie with frozen strawberries at any restaurant ""within the last 50 days"" to watch for symptoms of Hepatitis A. ""If illness occurs, seek medical care and take steps to protect others from the infection,"" the Aug. 19 public warning states. ""Other restaurants, and firms that supply restaurants, may also have received the frozen strawberries imported from Egypt. VDH continues to investigate cases and work with state and federal partners, ... to identify additional locations where the product may have been distributed."" Classic symptoms of Hepatitis A include jaundice, fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine and light-colored stools. The virus can be transmitted through direct contact with another person who has Hepatitis A or by consuming food or drink that has been contaminated with the virus. Frequent hand-washing with soap and warm water after using the bathroom, changing a diaper, or before preparing food can help prevent the spread of Hepatitis A. ""It is very important for people who have symptoms of Hepatitis A to stay home from work, especially if they work in food service,"" according to the Virginia health department. Routine vaccination against Hepatitis A has reduced the prevalence of the disease in the past decade. Vaccination -- which involves two injections given six months apart -- is available to anyone, but specifically recommended for children, travelers to certain countries, and for people at high risk for infection with the virus, which includes older adults and people with suppressed immune systems.

The other 25 states have a total of 121 people confirmed with the outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7. One person in California has died. At least 14 of the sick people have developed kidney failure.  Of the 102 victims for whom complete information is available, 52 have been admitted to hospitals, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's most recent update on May 2.  North Dakota'sDepartment of Health did not provide any details about the age or gender of the person confirmed as being an outbreak case. State health officials are investigating another potential case.  The onset dates for the illnesses in North Dakota were not provided by the state health department in its May 4 notice. During foodborne illness outbreaks, public health officials stress that there is a lag time of two to four weeks from the time a person becomes ill and they are included in the CDC's case count. Laboratory tests and confirmation tests must be conducted before doctors can report cases to local public health officials. Local departments then report to state health officials who in turn notify federal officials. As of Saturday, a specific source of the pre-chopped romaine lettuce that is associated with all but eight of the infected people remained unknown, according to federal officials. Eight people, all inmates at a prison in Alaska, ate romaine from whole heads before becoming sick. Prison officials helped the Food and Drug Administration trace the whole-head romaine to Harrison Farms in Yuma, AZ. Other traceback efforts have not been as successful. Based on information from the fresh produce industry, the FDA and CDC have been warning consumers, restaurants and retailers to avoid eating and selling romaine only from the Yuma area since April 13 when the leafy green was linked to the sick people.  The annual romaine harvest in the Southwest begins in November in Yuma and transitions with the weather to growing regions in southern California between mid-March and early April. ""The FDA has stated they cannot be certain that romaine lettuce from the Yuma region is no longer in the supply chain due to the 21-day shelf life,"" said Laura Cronquist, epidemiologist with the North Dakota health department. Product industry groups have been saying since the FDA's announcement on April 13 that Yuma-area romaine was likely no longer being shipped. Anyone who has eaten romaine lettuce and developed symptoms of E. coli infection should immediately seek medical attention and tell their doctors about their possible exposure pathogen. Specific tests are required to diagnose E. coli infections, which generally should not be treated with antibiotics. The most common symptoms of E. coli include diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Symptoms typically begin three to four days after exposure to the bacteria, but can take as long as 10 days. (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

That number is up 27 illnesses from an Oct. 30 report of 362, and Louisiana and Illinois have been added to the case map. CDC reports that 40 percent of victims have been hospitalized, and 74 percent were reported in California. Ill persons range in age from less than 1 year to 93 years, with a median age of 20 years. Fourteen percent of the victims have developed blood infections as a result of their illness. Typically, only five percent of people with Salmonella infections develop blood infections. Foster Farms has not initiated a recall, instead opting to comply with U.S. Department of Agriculture requests to mitigate issues at three central California facilities tied to the outbreak. The products involved in the outbreak are identified by one of three USDA mark of inspection numbers: P6137, P6137A and P7632. Kroger Co. stores, which also include Fred Meyer, Fry's, King Soopers and others, pulled implicated packages of Foster Farms chicken from their shelves earlier this month.

My ""chats"" have been in front of industry and governmental groups on every continent, except South America. I'm somewhat popular in China. Most of the audiences are receptive to both my experience representing  many of the most seriously injured people in nearly every major foodborne illness outbreak that has occurred in the U.S. since the 1993 Jack in the Box E. coli outbreak. I think, over time, many that I have sued to fairly compensate my clients have acquired a grudging respect that I do what I do not just for the money. However, there have been moments. I have had more than a few tense encounters with people who simply do not believe in the civil justice system. I have had a few boo, not applaud, or simply walk out. Most I have taken in somewhat good humor. A week ago I was in Hawaii, again giving my take on ways to avoid seeing me on the other side of a witness table. Things went well and the group was engaged - even the fellow with the bright red baseball hat emblazoned with ""Make America Great Again"" seemed to tolerate me. Then the question came: ""Mr. Marler, how do you sleep at night?  You sued me over an outbreak that did not happen and it was not my product."" At first I did not recognize the fellow, but as he spoke I recalled the outbreak. I tried to explain how we take what we do seriously and use both the law and science to determine who is at fault and therefore who should take legal responsibility. But, he was having none of it - he was convinced what I did was a ""shake down."" Yes, a ""shake down"" - here is the backstory: At first glance, it appeared that the E. coli O157:H7 infections experienced by Natalia and Andrea D'Ercole were simply part of a small cluster of cases occurring in San Diego and Orange County, California.  As part of the routine case investigation, San Diego County public health investigators learned that on October 12, 2008 the D'Ercole siblings had eaten at The Cheesecake Factory restaurant located in Fashion Valley Mall in San Diego. In neighboring Orange County, a 46-year-old man with an E. coli O157:H7 infection reported eating at a Cheesecake Factory restaurant located in Brea, California on October 13, 2008. Genetic testing by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) showed that Andrea, Natalia, and the Orange County patient were sickened with an indistinguishable strain of E. coli O157:H7, designated by PFGE pattern numbers EXHX01.4626/EXHA26.2558. The strain was so unusual that it triggered a cluster investigation.  Federal officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assigned Cluster Identification Number 08100NEXH-1mlc to the investigation. Through OutbreakNet, a national outbreak response unit staffed at the CDC, a fourth case-patient in the cluster was identified, an 18-year-old resident of South Dakota. This patient confirmed the association between illness and eating at a Cheesecake Factory restaurant.  She had eaten at The Cheesecake Factory in Fashion Valley Mall on October 12, 2008, while on vacation in San Diego. Natalia D'Ercole, the Orange County resident, and the South Dakota woman had symptom onset within five days of eating at the restaurant. Andrea D'Ercole's symptoms started several days after Natalia's onset. It is unclear whether Andrea's infection was due directly to her meal at the Cheesecake Factory, or if her illness was secondarily caused via person-to-person contact with her ill sister. Within a matter of days the outbreak grew beyond the Southern California confines.  Public health laboratories continued to report PFGE matches to the ""Cheesecake Factory"" strain of E. coli O157:H7. Case-patients were identified in Illinois, Florida, New Jersey, and Ohio. These individuals reported restaurant exposures but none ate at a Cheesecake Factory. This led investigators to suspect a contaminated ingredient was in the marketplace. Canadian investigators in Ontario identified an outbreak involving 55 people with at least 13 of them culturing positive for the outbreak strain. The majority of cases were linked to one of two restaurants. Illnesses occurred between Oct. 11 and Oct. 28. Canadian investigators conducted a case-control study and lettuce was statistically associated with illness. Product traceback showed that two restaurants tied to the outbreak shared a common produce supplier and that Andy Boy brand romaine lettuce was the only lettuce in common to all Canadian restaurants with outbreak cases. Its called the law and science. Those who ignore both are bound to again see me on the other side of a witness table. ""Shake down"" indeed.

""Only human mistakes create the environment for botulinum toxin to form,"" Clark told the Sacramento Bee newspaper.

",Tip Top Poultry Inc.,Chicken salad sandwiches,Potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes,Listeriosis,N/A,North Carolina and South Carolina3712,"Food Standards Scotland (FSS) has published a report that it says can be used as a basis to improve safety for artisan Scottish producers making cheese from unpasteurized milk. The literature review, by Catherine Donnelly, provides evidence to Scottish artisan cheesemakers and enforcement officials in managing the microbiological safety of artisan cheeses and those produced from unpasteurized milk. Donnelly, an expert on the microbiological safety of food, believes that making cheesemakers use pasteurized milk is not the best way to produce safe cheeses, She contends it is better to educate them on how to improve the safety of raw milk products. Contamination of raw milk, and products made with it, by pathogens cannot be eliminated despite efforts to control milk hygiene. Consequently, cheesemakers must implement a range of strict controls to ensure a safe product. Microbiological safety of cheese made from unpasteurized milk is dictated by the safety of raw milk used for its production. Improving milk hygiene can be done through herd management, mastitis control, a focus on feeding regimes, and sanitation during milking, storage and transportation to cheesemakers. The report outlines the evidence on food safety controls to reduce the risks of food poisoning bacteria in the production of raw milk cheeses. These controls include critical control points (CCPs), predictive modeling, and validation and verification of firms' processes such as the use of microbiological testing data. To achieve process control that assures consistent production of microbiologically safe and high quality cheeses, cheesemakers must routinely monitor microbiological and physiochemical results from milk and cheese testing. Microbiological and physicochemical data together should help verify a HACCP plan is operating as intended. Relevant pathogensThe main pathogens relevant to cheeses made from unpasteurized, raw milk are Listeria monocytogenes, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus. The United Kingdom regards any STEC as potentially pathogenic and does not recognize specific serotypes as more or less pathogenic. It considers the presence of STEC in food confirmed when stx genes are detected in an isolated E. coli strain. One of the highest profile cases that FSS has been involved in featured Dunsyre Blue cheese made by Errington Cheese from unpasteurized cow's milk. The cheese was linked to an E. coli O157 outbreak in 2016 that sickened 26 people. Seventeen of the patients required hospitalization and a 3-year-old girl died. The agency concluded the cheese was the source of the outbreak, but the company has always denied the link. This year, Errington Cheese was cleared of breaching food hygiene regulations. Errington Cheese has received more than PS250,000 ($317,000) in compensation from South Lanarkshire Council after the council seized products thought to be linked to the outbreak in 2016. The company has re-employed head cheesemaker Angela Cairns and another cheesemaker - Paul McAllister. Microbiological data provided by the Specialist Cheesemakers Association (SCA) showed lower prevalence of coagulase-positive staphylococci and generic E. coli in UK raw milk for cheese making compared to surveys in the United States. No Salmonella or E. coli O157:H7 were found in 298 and 225 samples analyzed. Listeria monocytogenes was detected in 43 of 639 samples, although this included results of re-sampling after detection. In the United Kingdom, there have been eight outbreaks linked to unpasteurized milk cheese since 1983 and 53 outbreaks globally (Yoon et al. 2016; Fox et al. 2017). Of the eight U.K. outbreaks, six were attributed to E. coli O157 and one each to Salmonella and Staphylococcus spp. Although not implicated in an outbreak connected to cheeses from unpasteurized milk, Listeria monocytogenes can be isolated from such cheese. The report recommends that during epidemiological investigations of outbreaks involving cheese, collection of compositional data such as pH levels, salt and moisture content, could reveal information about causative factors, including lack of process control. Assuring safety of cheese made from raw milk is influenced by use of raw milk of high microbiological quality with low pathogen contamination levels; rate and degree of acidification achieved during cheese making; rate of pathogen inactivation during cheese making and ageing and prevention of recontamination from the processing environment or at retail. For each cheese type produced in Scotland, consideration must be given to a number of factors, including raw milk testing, including milk filters; raw milk handling, storage and transportation; environmental monitoring and control of the cheese making environment; cleaning and sanitation; and good manufacturing practices (GMPs). Possible predictionsA number of predictive models are available to help cheesemakers make safety assessments by predicting their growth potential in cheese but most over-predict pathogen growth in raw milk cheese. The Raw Milk Cheese (RMC) Decision Support Tool is the most appropriate model for cheesemakers to determine the microbiological safety of their process and finished products. It was developed by the Australian Specialist Cheesemakers' Association and Dairy Food Safety Victoria (DFSV). Since most raw milk cheeses are produced by small manufacturers, there is likely to be variability in processing from batch to batch and such variability must be considered in challenge studies so the range of process efficacy can be determined. Surrogate organisms must possess the same characteristics as the pathogen, such as acid, salt or heat tolerance. Reasons including cost mean it is impractical for most artisan cheese producers to do challenge studies. Challenge studies have shown the microbiological risk of cheeses made from unpasteurized milk can be reduced by a proper acidification, ripening maturation process, and constant monitoring of the hygiene environments for milk production, cheese making and the post-manufacturing stage. Impact of cheese typeAs of August 2018, of 64 cheese types being produced in Scotland, 20 were manufactured from unpasteurized milk from cows, sheep and goats. Twenty-five of the 64 cheeses are hard cheese varieties and 22 are soft. Only one of the 22 soft varieties is made from unpasteurized milk, versus 12 of the 25 hard varieties made from unpasteurized milk. Cheese classification based on pH and Aw is useful for the assessment of risk of survival of STEC, Listeria monocytogenes and other pathogens but alternatives that account for processing steps where pathogens can be introduced or reduced should also be considered. Whilst sale of raw drinking milk is permitted in England and Wales, sale of it and unpasteurized cream has been banned in Scotland since 1983 following milk-related illnesses and 12 potentially associated deaths. There are no restrictions on the sale of raw milk cheeses in Scotland, provided they have been produced in compliance with European Union food hygiene regulations. STEC contamination of cheese can be prevented through milk hygiene and prevention of fecal contamination of milk and cheese. While surveys document a low prevalence of STEC in tested cheese, challenge testing studies show potential for survival during manufacture of a range of cheese types. The report also covers bacteriophages that have been used to control foodborne pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes in cheeses. Cheesemakers considering their use should be aware of the potential limitations such as phage resistance associated with this strategy. Advising artisan producers making raw milk cheeses to eliminate silage feeding in favor of dry hay or pasture feeding shows promise to reduce potential presence of Listeria monocytogenes, and potentially other pathogens, in milk used for cheese making. The report recommends providing one-on-one technical assistance to small scale cheesemakers to aid in development of individual Risk Reduction Protocols including guidance on validation and a survey of the microbiological quality of raw milk intended for artisan cheese production in Scotland.

",Errington Cheese,Dunsyre Blue cheese,E. coli O157 outbreak,N/A,26,United Kingdom2209,"A month after Thomson International Inc. initiated a recall of onions linked to a Salmonella outbreak, federal officials are reporting the patient tally has topped 1,000 in the United States. Canadian officials say hundreds are sick in that country. As of this week, 1,012 people across 47 states have been confirmed as being infected, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of those interviewed so far, 90 percent report they specifically remember eating onions or foods containing onions during the days before they developed symptoms of Salmonella infection. Of those patients with complete information available, 136 have been so sick they had to be admitted to hospitals. No deaths have been reported. Because of the delay between when a person becomes ill and when confirmed lab tests results are reported, there will likely be more patients identified in this outbreak. Initially it was thought only red onions were involved, but because of the way onions are grown, harvested and prepared for sale other varieties including yellow, white and sweet onions are under recall. Cross contamination of varieties is suspected. ""Of the 154 people who were asked what types of onions they ate, 103 (67 percent) ate red onions, 96 (62 percent) ate white onions, and 86 (56 percent) ate yellow onions. Most ill people reported eating more than one type of onion,"" according to the CDC update. See the full list of recalled onions and foods for U.S. consumers. In Canada, there are now 457 confirmed patients. One person has died, but it is not known if Salmonella contributed to the cause of death, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. "". . . based on the investigation findings to date, exposure to red onions imported from the USA has been identified as a likely source of the outbreak. Many of the ill individuals under investigation reported having eaten red onions before getting sick,"" according to the Canadian federal officials.  ""Through a collaborative investigation between public health and food safety partners in Canada and the U.S., traceback information has identified that the contaminated red onions are coming from Thomson International Inc. of Bakersfield, CA."" The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has issued food recall warnings for implicated products that were sent to Canada. Some of the products were possibly distributed nationally, according to the CFIA recall notices. Outbreak patients in Canada became sick between mid-June and early August. Of them, at least 66 have been hospitalized. Patients are between 1 and 100 years of age. Ill people reported eating red onions at home, in menu items ordered at restaurants and in residential care settings before becoming sick. Public health officials in both countries are urging consumers and business to discard any onions of unknown origin in addition to discarding all onions specifically under recall. About Salmonella infectionsFood contaminated with Salmonella bacteria does not usually look, smell, or taste spoiled. Anyone can become sick with a Salmonella infection. Infants, children, seniors, and people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of serious illness because their immune systems are fragile, according to the CDC. Anyone who has eaten any onions and developed symptoms of Salmonella infection should seek medical attention. Sick people should tell their doctors about the possible exposure to Salmonella bacteria because special tests are necessary to diagnose salmonellosis. Salmonella infection symptoms can mimic other illnesses, frequently leading to misdiagnosis. Symptoms of Salmonella infection can include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating contaminated food. Otherwise, healthy adults are usually sick for four to seven days. In some cases, however, diarrhea may be so severe that patients require hospitalization. Older adults, children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients, are more likely to develop a severe illness and serious, sometimes life-threatening conditions.

The affected batches of clover sprouts were distributed to Hy-Vee Food Stores, Fareway Food Stores and Jimmy John's restaurants in Iowa. The sprouts available at retail were packaged in in pint containers from Sprouts Unlimited Inc. with a blue label on the lid. The UPC code 7 32684 00013 6 is stamped on the bottom right side of the label.

Sprouts have long been a problem as my friend Doug has repeatedly warned on Barfblog: Kate Bernot of The Take Out wrote, ""If you ask anyone in food safety, 'What is the one food you will not eat?' Raw sprouts tops the list, always."" That's one of the first sentences out of the mouth of Doug Powell, a former professor of food safety and the publisher of barfblog, a frequently updated site that publishes evidence-based opinions on food safety. I've asked him whether food-safety fears about sprouts--those tiny, crunchy squiggles in your salad or sandwich--are well-founded. He tells me the public isn't concerned enough about them. ""Risk is inherent in the nature of the product which is why Walmart and Costco got rid of them,"" he says. (Kroger also stopped selling sprouts in 2012.) ""This is not a new problem. It's been going on for decades."" According to a paper he and three colleagues published in the journal Food Control in 2012, sprouts have been responsible for at least 55 documented foodborne outbreaks affecting more than 15,000 people globally in the past two decades. The Food And Drug Administration tallies 46 reported outbreaks of foodborne illness in the United States linked to sprouts between 1996 and 2016, accounting for for 2,474 illnesses, 187 hospitalizations, and three deaths. In an effort to reduce these outbreaks, the FDA in 2017 collected 825 samples of sprouts from across the U.S.; 14 of those tested positive for E. coli, listeria, or Salmonella. Here's a table of over 75 sprout-related outbreaks going back to 1973. (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

The outbreak is linked to chilled roast pork. Previously 44 people were reported to be sick, with half of them treated in hospital. Health authorities are investigating the illnesses with most in Andalusia but Asturias, Extremadura, Madrid, Catalonia and Aragon also reporting patients. Normally there are about 300 infections by Listeria in Spain every year. Spanish media reported a 90-year-old woman died and more than 50 people have needed hospital treatment. Spanish food agency confirms detailsThe Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition (AESAN) advised anyone that had a roasted meat product of the brand ""La Mecha"" made by Magrudis SL not to consume it. The product was marketed in whole pieces generally weighing more than 1-kilogram but varying by piece, and halves weighing less than 1-kilogram but variable according to each piece. It is sold almost entirely in Andalusia. Some has been distributed in Madrid and Extremadura as well as a limited quantity in Castilla- La Mancha, Castilla y Leon and Tenerife. None has been sent outside of Spain. The agency reported it was informed on Aug. 16 through the Spanish Coordinated System for Rapid Exchange of Information (SCIRI) from a notification by health authorities in Andalusia of an outbreak caused by Listeria monocytogenes linked to eating this meat. Health officials in Andalusia extended the alert to include the following ""La Mecha"" branded products: Chicharron Andaluz, Lomo Casero Al Pimenton and Lomo Al Jerez distributed in Andalusia and Madrid and Lomo Al Pimenton distributed only in Andalusia. On Aug. 5, an outbreak of food poisoning was declared in a town in Seville and food samples were taken for analysis. Other outbreaks were reported between Aug. 12 and 14 and samples were also analyzed. On Aug. 14 a lab in Seville reported a positive result of Listeria monocytogenes from the ""La Mecha"" branded meat, which is prepared by a company in the municipality of Seville. Products with the ""La Mecha"" brand that have been manufactured since May are considered affected since the expiration date is three months. Two babies lostHealth authorities of Andalusia inspected the manufacturing company and ordered the withdrawal of affected meat from the market. FACUA-Consumers in Action, a consumer group, claimed two women have lost their babies as part of the outbreak. One woman from Seville had to have an abortion in the last trimester of pregnancy and the other lost her baby at the Virgen del Rocio Hospital in Seville. The organization reported the implicated meat is sold at retail but also in small food stores, butchers, supermarkets as well as being served at catering establishments. It can take up to 70 days after exposure to Listeria for symptoms of listeriosis to develop. Symptoms of infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache and neck stiffness. Pregnant women, the elderly, young children, and people who have weakened immune systems are particularly at risk of serious illnesses and life-threatening infections. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, their infections can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth.

Don't get me wrong. The information superhighway is a groovy trip and I'm happy to be along for the ride via this incredible bit of technology sitting on my lap. It's so much more convenient than the key punch cards I bundled up in rubber bands for my semester project for ""Introduction to Fortran"" at the University of Kansas. If only our legislative and regulatory environment could evolve as quickly. Take the ongoing multi-state outbreak of Hepatitis A and the related recall of frozen strawberries imported from the Egyptian firm International Company for Agricultural Production and Processing (ICAPP). All of the strawberries ICAPP sent to the United States since Jan. 1 are covered by the recall, which was posted on the Food and Drug Administration's website on Halloween. Federal and state officials have been aware of the link between the outbreak and the strawberries since early August. Initially reported to have been distributed to Tropical Smoothie Cafe locations in Virginia, it turns out the frozen strawberries from Egypt went to five distributors that sent them to foodservice operations across America. FDA named those five distributors this past week, but those names are of little use to consumers. The data those distributors have is what the public needs. The records of where the strawberries went are readily available, but not to the public. Regulations prohibit FDA from releasing such confidential corporate information -- CCI as the FDA folks refer to it. Ironic, isn't it, that big business so often calls for deregulation. I'm betting the CCI clauses are not among the government regs corporations and industry lobbyists are seeking to eliminate when they talk about government being too big. So in the name of protecting businesses, the feds can't say where the strawberries went. Be assured, though, ""the FDA is working with these firms to help identify further downstream customers who may have received the recalled frozen strawberry products,"" according to the agency's outbreak/recall update Wednesday. The same CCI excuse and reassurances came from FDA officials earlier this year in response to questions about the General Mills flour recall. We still don't know where all of that flour went. Other food manufacturers dribbled out recalls of baking mixes and other products made with the flour that is linked to a multi-state E. coli outbreak. An extra sense of urgency is built into the strawberry situation, though. Unlike the people exposed to E. coli via the flour, some of the potentially millions of people who have been served the recalled strawberries in schools, restaurants, hospitals, hotels and at other venues and events could benefit from post-exposure vaccinations for Hepatitis A -- but only if they get treatment within two weeks of exposure. With the strawberries having been in nationwide distribution since January, many people who have been exposed are obviously past the two-week mark. But the FDA said Wednesday that officials know the strawberries were served as recently as Oct. 27. California officials acted quickly, compiling and posting on Oct. 30 a list of entities that received the strawberries. The list is being updated and stood at about 3,000 locations last time I checked it. Michigan has a shorter list, with less than 100 locations as of Saturday night. The information for the state list is being provided hit and miss by county and city officials. Colorado's Weld County posted a notice Saturday naming two restaurants in its jurisdiction that received the implicated fruit. So the question remains, with 3,141 counties in the United States and one Food and Drug Administration, why is the public waiting for distribution information to drip out one county at a time when the FDA could open the tap? If Mr. Spock were to answer that question, he'd probably say it's an example of the needs of the few, aka big business, out-weighing the needs of the many, aka you and me. It's time to remove the gag, revise the regs with all of us in mind instead of the few, and let the FDA share distribution information during recalls, especially during recalls related to ongoing outbreaks.

La Luz Mexican Grill, located in Old Town Fort Collins, closed ""voluntarily"" on Aug. 21 after Colorado's Larimer County Department of Health and Environment (LCDHE) linked the popular restaurant to the outbreak. The LCDHE gave the Old Towe La Luz permission to reopen this past Thursday, but the restaurant opted to remain closed over the weekend. Health inspectors were at the restaurant first thing Sept. 6, giving it a 70-minute follow-up inspection. After the closure extended into three weeks, inspectors found on Sept. 6 that the restaurant still had two major violations, leaving it with a mediocre score of 70 points out of 100. It lost 10 points for not being free of spoilage and adulteration, and another 20 points for cross-contamination from equipment involving animal foods stored below cooked and ready to eat foods. Meanwhile, LCDHE also reported the Salmonella outbreak it first reported on Aug. 21 has grown from that initial six cases to 29 confirmed cases of Salmonella and all involved La Luz customers. Several of the people with confirmed infections have been hospitalized. State health officials are now assisting in the investigation, which has yet to determine the exact source of the pathogen. La Luz was named as a defendant on Aug. 31 in Colorado District Court lawsuit by a Fort Collins couple who, along with their 5-year old son, are victims of the Salmonella outbreak. Old Town La Luz owner Peter Shultz posted an apology to customers late last week. After leaving its phones to go unanswered during the weekend, La Luz did begin taking calls on Monday, promising customers the restaurant will reopen today. La Luz Mexican Grill is at 200 Walnut St. in Fort Collins, CO. It is one of three restaurants in the area flying the La Luz flag. The other two are located at 140 E. Broadwalk Drive in Fort Collins and 1518 Madison Ave. in nearby Loveland, CO. Those restaurants are under separate ownership and are not implicated in the salmonella outbreak. The Old Town La Luz has had troubles with restaurant inspections in the past couple of years. In eight inspections since January 2017, the best rating it has received was a ""fair."" Its other scores were one ""unacceptable"" and six inspections that ended with ""not rated."" After it closed, LCDHE said it found the restaurant was concerned with ""the safety of its customers and the integrity of its food supply and wants to prevent any further illness as best they can."" Before the Sept. 6 inspection, restaurant inspectors spent about more than two hours at La Luz doing a follow-up visit on Aug. 17. It was found ""out of compliance"" for cooling, cold holding, permitting employees to eat, smoke, or drink while on duty, maintenance of cutting boards and utensils, re-using service articles, lighting, missing hand soap, hand towels or dryer, and for evidence of insects on the premises. Salmonella is bacteria that can cause infections affecting the intestinal tract, urinary tract, bloodstream or other body tissues. Salmonella is often spread to people through consumption of contaminated food. The bacteria can be found in many foods including raw meats, eggs and fresh produce. Salmonella can be spread when people who are sick who handle food. Some people who are infected are asymptomatic and can spread the infection unknowingly. Symptoms may include, diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, vomiting, and bloody stool. Symptoms typically appear 6-72 hours after eating contaminated food and will usually last for 4 to 7 days. In severe cases, the symptoms may last longer or require hospitalization. Salmonella is responsible for about 1 million illnesses, 23,000 hospitalizations and 450 deaths each year, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

I had never heard of Listeria or had food poisoning until I contracted the disease,"" he said. ""There was a guy I knew a lot, he was a childhood friend from school and he died from listeriosis. He was a few years older than me at that time, he was 20 and I was 17."" The now 21-year-old remembers being in church in August 2017 when he started to feel unwell. ""On Sunday at church I had a headache and the next day at school it became a severe headache and it continued the day after and then at night on the third day I decided to go to hospital. I was supposed to call an ambulance but managed to go there with my father. When we got there I was still having the headache and I got to the emergency room and was diagnosed there."" College plansThe 2017 and 2018 listeriosis outbreak in South Africa was linked to ready-to-eat (RTE) meat products and caused more than 1,050 illnesses and at least 218 deaths. It was traced in March 2018 to a RTE processed meat product called polony, which is similar to boloney, made at a factory in Polokwane run by Enterprise Foods, then-owned by Tiger Brands. In August 2020, Tiger Brands agreed to sell its processed meats division, which includes Enterprise Foods. Mahlngu used to eat polony all the time at school and at home but now avoids it. ""I try to avoid a lot of products that are related to the ones that faced listeriosis, not because of Tiger Brands per se, just for health purposes. I believe they have made the correct arrangements to solve the mistakes they had that year. Mistakes happen, life is life, but I would appreciate an apology from them to the community of its customers. It wasn't on purpose, they were not trying to kill us."" The future for Mahlngu includes finishing a financial accounting course. ""I did my first year when I turned 18. I have two years left to finish the course. I am on hold due to financial difficulties but definitely want to finish it, that is my main goal right now,"" he said. ""My future holds a lot of brightness and joy. I have a lot of plans that I believe will come true. I am pending on the college degree in financial accounting, if I can finish it that will be one of my short term goals.""

""The E. coli was found in a milk sample from a batch of goat milk that was not sold to the public. However, it is possible that other subsequent batches could contain the harmful bacteria. From those subsequent milkings, nine quarts of the raw goat milk were sold at the Phinney Farmers Market and one quart at the Vashon Farmers Market."" As of the initiation of the recall on Wednesday, Burton Hill officials were not aware of any illnesses in connection with their recalled milk.

If you have any questions about the recall, please call the company at 206-940-6805,"" the recall notice states. Although it is legal to sell unpasteurized, raw milk at retail locations in Washington state, health officials warn there are serious potential health risks if that milk is contaminated with pathogenic bacteria. Consumers should read the warning label on retail raw milk containers in the state. Anyone who has consumed any of the recalled unpasteurized raw milk and developed symptoms of E. coli infection is advised to seek medical attention. Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infections may cause diarrhea, stomach cramps and bloody stool. Symptoms generally appear three to four days after exposure, but they can take as long as nine days to appear. Anyone experiencing these symptoms should contact a health care provider. The infection sometimes causes hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a serious disease in which red blood cells are destroyed and the kidneys fail.

I learned about the reality of this foodborne pathogen on Riley's deathbed. When he was only a few months old, I justified being out to sea on a Navy submarine by telling myself that I was making the world a safer place for him, and I thought that I would spend the rest of my life making up lost time with him when he was older. Riley would now be older than I was during that outbreak.  I never got to see him grow older than he appears in the few photos and videos from so long ago. Over the years since his death, however, I have seen news of recalls and outbreaks and deaths on a far too regular basis. I have also seen much improvement in food safety. We have gained new federal food safety regulations and policies at the USDA and, most recently at the FDA. We have witnessed advancements in science and data collection and even a whole new ""culture of food safety."" We have training, certifications, university programs, conferences, magazines, books, and even movies that serve to inform and motivate new generations of food safety experts. Many of the changes in food safety policies came about through the hard work of victims, families, advocacy groups and industry leaders. Statistics and charts alone achieve little without victim's voices. Facts rarely motivate policymakers as much as seeing the faces and stories. I am very proud of their efforts. I am also proud to have stood with them and before them, trying to prevent other parents from looking at their family table with one chair forever empty due to preventable illnesses and deaths from foodborne pathogens. One thing that hits me hard lately is how the faces and stories of victims from mass shootings are seemingly not enough to bring about change in terms of gun control. While no new policies will bring back the dead, they would bring hope and an increased safety for others. I am saddened by the thought that so many parents will live with the belief that their child's death did not result in some element of change. Perhaps the reasons matter not as to why parents worry about making the world a safer place for their children. Too many homes in this country include a chair forever empty at a family table due to reasons that could and should have been prevented. -- Darin Detwiler Ph.D. is the assistant dean, the Lead Faculty of the MS in Regulatory Affairs of Food and Food Industry, and Professor of Food Policy at Northeastern University in Boston.

That's how some people see the surge of interest in growing leafy greens in greenhouses. No doubt about it, this approach to farming has increased dramatically in every corner of the country, even the South. Not surprisingly, food safety has been one of the driving forces pushing indoor farming forward. Repeated recalls over the past several years  of romaine lettuce contaminated by the potentially deadly E. coli O157:H7 pathogen grown in the Yuma, AZ, and Salinas, Calif., regions have been enough to have consumers shying away from the popular lettuce and often other leafy greens.  The most recent romaine outbreak just before Thanksgiving 2019, originating in the  the Salinas, CA, growing  area triggered yet more apprehensions about the lettuce.  Advice to consumers from the CDC just after Thanksgiving solidified those fears. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised consumers not to eat any romaine at all from the Salinas growing area until the outbreak was over -- unless it was grown indoors. That outbreak has since been declared over. In effect, the CDC was giving greenhouse-grown romaine a food safety thumbs up.  ""Hydroponically and greenhouse-grown romaine from any region does not appear to be related to the current outbreak,"" said the agency on its December 2019 update about the outbreak in the Salinas growing area. It also noted that the lettuce might be labeled as ""indoor grown."" That came as welcome news to greenhouse growers -- and also to buyers such as restaurants and other foodservice establishments that wanted to keep offering romaine to their customers. In many cases, demand outstripped supply. ""The more outbreaks we have, the more this trend will probably grow,"" said Kirk Smith, director of the Minnesota Integrated Food Safety Center of Excellence, one of six centers around the U.S. designated by the CDC to strengthen the safety of the nation's food system. ""There's an upswing in interest in a big, big way,"" said John Bonner, co-owner of Great Lake Growers. ""I've seen consumers' knowledge base about this increase. They like that it's safer, fresher and lasts longer. It's almost like 'why wouldn't you buy greenhouse salad greens.' It's a catalyst for change."" Looking ahead, he believes indoor growing will happen on a bigger scale yet, although, as he quickly concedes:  ""It might take 20 years. ""But it's coming,"" he said. Ryan Oates, founder and owner of Tyger River Smart Farm in South Carolina, sees hydroponics as ""the future of farming"" because there are so many advantages to it, among them conserving water and nutrients. Also, you can do it year round. ""We'll see more and more of it,"" he says in a video on Tyger River's website. ""You'll see a lot of crops moving in that direction."" As for food safety, Oates said the biggest advantage is that you're growing inside greenhouses, which allows me to keep things really clean. ""It's a lot easier to do that than growing outdoors."" Because indoor growing is a controlled environment, the farmers don't have to deal with wildlife, domestic animals, and birds flying overhead -- all of which can contaminate the crops. Bendon Kreieg, a partner and sales manager at Revol Greens said that the government's advice on this is definitely helping. ""We are seeing an uptick in demand from retailers and restaurants because it has such a major impact on their business when they suddenly can't serve salads,"" Kreieg said. A spokesperson for Gotham Greens, a New York-based operation with three locations in New York City, two in Chicago, one under construction in Baltimore, and more underway in other states, told a reporter that the farm has been selling out of its greenhouse grown leafy greens every day. Janeen Wright, editor for Greenhouse Grower magazine, said that although the publication has always covered greenhouse cultivation of vegetables -- as well as ornamental and nursery plants -- it has been covering the vegetable side of the industry a lot more recently.  Referring to the romaine recalls in 2018 and 2019, Wright said growers have told her that the recalls have really helped them ""get a name for themselves.""  ""Unfortunately, all of these recalls will be a concern for consumers,"" said Scott Horsfall, CEO of the California Leafy Greens Marketing Agreement. ""The plantings (for romaine lettuce) are down but there's still demand for it."" As for whether greenhouse lettuces and greens will overtake field grown lettuces and greens, Horsfall doesn't think that will ever happen especially considering the vast quantity of the crops that are field grown. ""I certainly haven't seen concerns about this on the production side of the industry,"" he said. Even so, greenhouse farming is making important strides. During the 52 weeks ending Sept. 29, 2019, sales of produce marked as greenhouse grown increased 7.6 percent and sales of produce described as locally grown increased 23.2 percent, according to the latest Fresh Facts on Retail report from United Fresh Produce Association, a trade organization. The ""local"" aspect is important because greenhouses are located in many regions of the country and therefore lettuces grown in them don't have to be shipped across the country from Yuma and Salinas during the winter months. Because the lettuces and greens can be grown year-round they have an extra ""local"" advantage. In the winter, more than 90 percent of the lettuces and greens in the United States are grown in the Yuma, AZ, and Salinas, CA, growing regions. Salinas is often referred to as America's ""Salad Bowl,"" and Yuma, the ""Lettuce Capital of the World.""  Yuma is home to nine factories that produce bagged lettuce and salad mixes. Each of these plants processes more than 2 million pounds of lettuce per day during Yuma's peak production months, November thru March. ""It's a long way from Yuma to Cleveland,"" said John Bonner, co-owner of Great Lake Growers based in Ohio. He pointed out that the difference in distance between the two is part of why the lettuces and greens don't arrive in stores and restaurants as fresh as they do when they arrive in establishments that are near his greenhouses. In addition, consumers' interest in locally grown food has risen dramatically. Some are even referring to the lettuces from the Yuma and Salinas growing regions as ""corporate lettuce."" Controlled-environment agriculture, another way to describe greenhouse cultivation when done according to certain standards, is helping grow the local food market. The USDA estimated they would reach $20 billion in sales by 2019, up from $12 billion in 2014. Peace of mind about food safety is another important part of the puzzle when it comes to increased demand for greenhouse produce. A spokesperson for Gotham Greens agrees that the food safety scares originating from large-scale farms have buyers looking for lettuces and greens grown on a smaller scale and closer to home. For the most part, greenhouse growers don't use pesticides or other harmful-to-humans chemicals on their crops, and many follow strict organic standards. Greenhouses: The indoor optionWhen you think of farming, you think of soil. In contrast, most indoor farming -- or greenhouse growing -- does away with soil. Instead, crops are grown hydroponically in controlled sterile environments. In most hydroponic systems, plants are grown in nutrient-rich water, instead of in soil. The water is rich in phosphorus, nitrogen and calcium.   At the top of the list when it comes to the advantages of hydroponics is that it requires only 10 percent to 16 percent of the same amount of water to produce vegetables as conventional irrigation systems in outdoor farming. That's because water in a hydroponic system is captured and reused, rather than allowed to run off and drain into the environment, according to indoor growers. That's especially important in areas where water is scarce. In California, for example, conventional outdoor agriculture accounts for 80 percent of total water use.  The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has been implementing hydroponic farming in areas of the world beset with food shortages. There are currently ongoing projects to establish large hydroponic farms in  Latin American and African countries.  NASA has even gotten into the act. In the late 20th century, physicists and biologists put their heads together to come up with a way to grow food in space. They began by growing plants on the International Space Station, opting for hydroponices because it needs less space and fewer resources -- and produces vastly higher yields -- than growing in soil. In 2015, astronauts actually dined on the first space-grown vegetables. Although there hasn't been much government funding for research on greenhouse agriculture, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently gave Michigan State University $2.7 million for research into indoor growing techniques. In addition to that, the researchers have won industry grants bringing the project total to $5.4 million. A focus of the research will be gathering information on the economically viability of greenhouse growing.  Food safety and hydroponicsFood-safety scientist Kirk Smith, who has been leading investigations into food safety outbreaks for many years, said one thing that has emerged in outbreak investigations is that E. coli contamination in produce almost always comes from irrigation water used on fields.  Making things more complicated, the Food Safety Modernization Act, signed into law by President Obama in 2011, has yet to establish definitive standards for agriculture water quality. Another challenge beyond irrigation is washing the field-grown produce after it's been harvested. That step is when using clean water is especially critical, otherwise contamination from one head of lettuce can spread to the rest of the produce in the factory.  Food safety scientists warn that even though a package of bagged salad greens that have been field grown says the greens have been triple washed, that doesn't mean there's no chance of some of the greens being contaminated. In the case of E. coli, for example, the pathogen can hold on tight and resist being washed away. In contrast, most greenhouses use municipal water and many wash their greens with running water instead of dunking them into a tank. Some don't even need to wash them since they never come into contact with any water simply because it's the roots that are being watered, not the leaves. Bonner said that his farm makes sure the water it uses is clean and tested. ""We have extensive testing for E. coli,"" he said. ""We're monitoring it every second."" As for farmworkers, Bonner said one part of the audit his company goes through is dedicated strictly to food safety and farmworkers. ""We're in a building, and the bathrooms are right there,"" he said. ""And we have handwashing sinks all over the place."" Because most greenhouse farms grow food year round, there's no need to rely on a seasonal workforce. In Bonner's case, the company works with a local Amish community whose young people are eager to work for his company. In other cases where greenhouses are located in cities, farmworkers live in city apartments. This stability in housing and location gives greenhouse farms a stable workforce. Nothing's perfectOf course, there's no guarantee that a foodborne pathogens will never occur in greenhouse settings.  And because most lettuces and greens are eaten raw, they don't go through a ""kill step"" to kill pathogens that might be on them. Many of the foods popular with indoor growers -- lettuces, sprouts, fresh herbs, microgreens and wheat grass  -- carry the highest risk of outdoor produce, some of that because it grows so close to the ground. That's why prevention is so important, the greenhouse growers say. This would include paying attention to how water, tools, animal intrusions, pests and human handling plays a role in preventing food from being contaminated.  What is it about romaine?Romaine lettuce is ""particularly susceptible"" to E. coli, said Keith Warriner a University of Guelph (Canada) professor, in an interview with City News. During research, Warriner said, scientists discovered that out of all the lettuces, E. coli likes romaine the best. A study the food safety scientist conducted showed that extracts of romaine lettuce actually brought E. coli out of a dormant state when it's in the soil. Once out of its dormant state, which can last up to a year, it can flourish. Warriner describes several reasons why romaine is particularly susceptible. To begin with, the crop is mostly grown in Arizona and California. That's cattle country, and irrigation water used on the romaine fields can become contaminated with bacteria from animal feces via water runoff and dust in the air. Added to that, because both states have hot weather, the lettuce needs an abundance of water. Warriner pointed out that even though other leafy greens like spinach and kale are also grown in the same areas, and under similar conditions, their leaves are, as he described them, ""as tough as nails."" Romaine is considered the most nutritious lettuce when compared to red leaf, green leaf, butterhead and iceberg. Although it's low in fiber, it's high in minerals, such as calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, and potassium. It's also naturally low in sodium. Another plus is that romaine lettuce is packed with Vitamin C, Vitamin K, and folate. And it's a good source of beta carotene, which converts into Vitamin A in the body.

The outbreak was part of a multi-country investigation in 2016 and linked to eggs imported from Poland. Control measures were taken in that country and internationally and all eggs sourced from implicated Salmonella contaminated farms were removed from the market. After an initial decline, infections continued to be reported in the U.K. in 2017 and 2018, indicating not all sources of contamination had been eliminated. There were 421 cases of Salmonella Enteritidis linked to the outbreak in 2017 and 2018. A Public Health England (PHE) spokeswoman told Food Safety News that findings have been shared with Europe and Poland. ""The results of the investigation implicating the Polish egg supply chain in this outbreak have been disseminated to the relevant EU and Polish authorities to enable control measures to be taken by the authorities in the EU and Poland, in line with EU regulations regarding Salmonella Enteritidis contamination in laying chicken flocks and we await the outcomes of this communication,"" she said. Some of the cases have been linked to consumption of Polish eggs that were used in various dishes and served at catering premises and Chinese restaurants. Nick Phin, deputy director of the national infection service at PHE, said: ""Public Health England has been working with the Food Standards Agency, public health and food safety authorities in the devolved administrations, and the Animal and Plant Health Agency to investigate an outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis, which has been linked to eggs sourced from Poland. The results of the U.K.'s investigation have been communicated to the authorities responsible for public health and food safety in the EU so further control measures can be taken."" Polish egg recalls Three recalls have occurred this year in Poland because of detection of Salmonella on the surface of shell eggs. The latest was in May for eggs with the code 3-PL14271307 produced by Ferma Zlote Jajko and packed at Ovos Sp. z.o.o. In April, the same issue was found for eggs with code 3PL 02181303 produced by ""Jajo-Wojciechowicz"" Wojciech Wojciechowicz. One month before, eggs with code 3PL30051328K3 produced by Fermy Drobiu Wozniak and distributed by Jeronimo Martins Polska S.A. were recalled. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is not collecting outbreak data on a regular basis and the latest data was from an epidemiological update in November 2018. Overall, 1,412 cases are associated with the outbreak: 532 confirmed and 166 probable cases since February 2017, and 343 historical confirmed and 367 historical probable cases between 2012 and 31 January 2017. Since 2012 and up to November 2018, the U.K. has recorded more than 600 cases, almost 300 are from the Netherlands and nearly 200 from Belgium. At least two deaths have been reported - a five year old child in Croatia and another patient in Hungary. Outbreak-confirmed cases belong to four different whole genome sequencing (WGS) clusters. ECDC offers sequencing services for countries reporting probable cases of human Salmonella Enteritidis isolates with Multiple-Locus Variable number tandem repeat Analysis (MLVA) profiles 2-9-7-3-2, 2-9-6-3-2, 2-9-10-3-2, 2-10-6-3-2, 2-10-8-3-2 or 2-11-8-3-2. Likely outbreak is ongoing Routine WGS-based surveillance for Salmonella is not happening yet and monitoring is based on MLVA profiles associated with the outbreak. However, MLVA submissions have dropped as countries are moving to WGS. Only two isolates with the implicated MLVA types have been reported in the European Surveillance System (TESSy) since the November update. ""It is likely the outbreak is still ongoing, but we won't have evidence on this until we collect new information. In order to have the updated case numbers we would have to contact the countries and ask for their WGS data. This will be done ahead of the next epidemiological update, for which we don't have a date yet,"" an ECDC spokeswoman told Food Safety News. ""Salmonella Enteritidis follows seasonal patterns and in previous winters there has been a low number of cases, while peaks were observed from June to October."" The spokeswoman said in the last three years the agency has informed risk managers at national and European level that the outbreak was still ongoing. ""Since the beginning of the outbreak, ECDC has been liaising with relevant authorities in the affected EU/EEA countries, the European Food Safety Authority and the European Commission to facilitate the coordination of investigation and response measures,"" she said. Outbreak control is designated part of risk management, which is the responsibility of member states. More than 1,000 cases in three years A study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal found 18 EU and EEA countries reported 838 confirmed and 371 probable cases between May 2015 and October 2018. A total of 509 cases were reported in 2016, after which the number steadily increased. Two strains of Salmonella Enteritidis in human cases were also identified in Salmonella-positive eggs and primary production premises in Poland, confirming the source of the outbreak. After control measures were implemented, case numbers decreased, but increased again in March, 2017, and the rise continued into 2018. ""The re-emergence of cases suggests that outbreak strains have continued to enter the food chain, although changes in strain population dynamics and fewer cases indicate that control measures had some effect. Routine use of WGS in Salmonella surveillance and outbreak response promises to identify and stop outbreaks in the future,"" wrote researchers.

The recalled ""Green Fields Farms Rogers Texas Ground Beef"" sparked concern at the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) because its expiration date is more than two years away -- Aug. 8, 2020. The recall notice did not indicate whether any illnesses have been reported in connection with the recalled hamburger. ""FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers,"" according to the recall notice posted shortly after midnight June 20. ""Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. ""The problem was discovered on June 19 by FSIS during routine inspection activities. The product was tested by the establishment and found to be positive for (E. coli) O103 under their sampling program."" There is little labeling information on the 1-pound plastic bags that can be used to identify the recalled ground beef. The plain white labels have black printing with a production date of Aug. 8, 2017, and an expiration caste of Aug. 8, 2020. The labels say ""COOK USE ONLY"" and have the instruction ""DO NOT refreeze after defrosting.""  The recalled ground beef also has the establishment number ""EST. 34449"" printed inside the USDA mark of inspection on the labels. The raw, frozen hamburger was shipped to a retailer who sold it at a farmer's market in Roger, TX, according to the FSIS recall notice. Anyone who has eaten any of the recalled ground beef and developed symptoms of E. coli infection should seek medical attention and tell their doctors about their possible exposure to the bacteria. Specific tests are required to diagnose E. coli infections, which can be confused with other illnesses. Antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended for E. coli infections. Symptoms usually begin two to four days after exposure. Symptoms usually include diarrhea which is often bloody, and vomiting for most people. Most healthy adults recover within a week. However, high risk groups can develop life-threatening conditions, including kidney failure. High-risk groups include children younger than 5 years old, older adults, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems.

This time it's Cozy Vale Creamery of Tenino, WA. The Washington State Department of Agriculture inspectors discovered the contamination in a sample of the dairy's raw milk and is working with the dairy owners to determine the source of the Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, according to the recall notice. Although the implicated raw milk is being removed from retail stores, there is concern consumers may have the milk in their homes because it is not yet out of date. The recall covers all Cozy Vale (Valley) Creamery raw milk in quart, half-gallon and gallon plastic jugs with best-by dates of Feb. 27 through March 4. It was sold at the on-farm store, one drop off location, and several retail stores throughout Western Washington. Anyone who has consumed any of the recalled milk and developed symptoms of E. coli infection should seek medical attention and tell their doctors about the possible exposure to the bacteria. As of the posting of the recall notice on Tuesday, no confirmed illnesses had been linked to the Cozy Vale Creamery unpasteurized raw milk. ""Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infections may cause severe diarrhea, stomach cramps and bloody stool,"" according to the recall notice. ""Symptoms generally appear three to four days after exposure, but can take as long as nine days to appear. ""The infection sometimes causes hemolytic uremic syndrome, (HUS) a serious disease in which red blood cells are destroyed and the kidneys fail. Infants, children, pregnant women, the elderly and those with compromised immune systems are especially at risk."" Consumers who have the recalled milk in their homes are urged not to drink it and to return it to the place of purchase for a refund.

The Department of Health is investigating the possible food poisoning in Mpumalanga, Eastern Cape and Gauteng provinces. The agency met with environmental health practitioners from the three affected provinces and municipalities to get more information, including the product brand name, supplier or manufacturer and stores where food was purchased. Leftovers of food products have been collected from some affected households and sent for laboratory testing. The National Consumer Commission (NCC) has launched an investigation involving Grandisync CC, the supplier of Howe Instant Noodles based in Uitenhage in the Eastern Cape. This follows allegations that three children who died in the Eastern Cape might have consumed Howe 2 minute noodles but lab results are still pending. The agency said based on information it has been given by other regulators and the supplier, it has ""reasonable suspicion"" to believe that Grandisync CC supplied unsafe goods or items that posed a potential risk to the public. Unsubstantiated claimsHealth officials have said there may be a recall of concerned products should the evidence indicate that this is required. The South African Human Rights Commission condemned messages on social media which claimed possible contamination of the noodles was the result of tampering by foreign nationals. ""The Commission reminds the public that official sources are still investigating the possible contamination. At this stage there is no evidence to suggest any possible tampering or any link with a foreign owned businesses. Should there be cause for concern, the authorities will communicate this."" A total of five deaths, three children in the Eastern Cape and two in Limpopo, are being linked to the noodles, said the Commission.

This recall was triggered by Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) test results. No confirmed illnesses have been reported to federal officials, according to a recall notice posted by the CFIA. Sobeys Inc. reported the bagged, chopped kale salad was distributed in the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan. Officials are urging consumers to not eat the recalled salad mix. The recalled kale salad is packaged in 255-gram plastic bags with a UPC number of 0 68820 13305 6 and one of the following best-by dates: 19 OC 28; 19 OC 31; 19 NO 01; 19 NO 02; 19 NO 03. About Listeria infectionsFood contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes may not look or smell spoiled but can still cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections. Anyone who has eaten any recalled product and developed symptoms of Listeria infection should seek medical treatment and tell their doctors about the possible Listeria exposure. Also, anyone who has eaten any of the recalled products should monitor themselves for symptoms during the coming weeks because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to Listeria for symptoms of listeriosis to develop. Symptoms of Listeria infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache, and neck stiffness. Specific laboratory tests are required to diagnose Listeria infections, which can mimic other illnesses. Pregnant women, the elderly, young children, and people such as cancer patients who have weakened immune systems are particularly at risk of serious illnesses, life-threatening infections, and other complications. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, their infections can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or even stillbirth.

Louis Sand has decided. In his ruling, the federal judge in Albany, GA, said Parnell had failed to show good cause for keeping the judicial document sealed. Parnell, his brother Michael, and Mary Wilkerson, the former quality control boss for the now-defunct Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) are less than one month away from the start of their federal jury trial on multiple felony counts stemming from the deadly 2008-09 outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium. And the pre-trial action is also getting deadly serious. Here's some of what's happening: Stewart Parnell's defense team from Gentry Locke Rakes &amp; Moore LLP in Roanoke, VA, is demanding the exclusion of Dr. Ian Williams as an expert witness at trial. Williams is chief of the Outbreak Response and Prevention Branch (ORPB) at the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. In that position, he oversees the national network of epidemiologists and other public health officials who investigate multistage outbreaks of foodborne, waterborne, and other enteric illnesses in the U.S. He has essentially been the top CDC expert on nationally significant foodborne outbreaks since 1994. Defense attorney Thomas J. Bondurant, Jr., says Williams should be excluded as an expert witness for a variety of reasons, including the fact that he was subjected to an investigative interview by USDA's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and because including a top CDC official as an expert witness only 33 days before trial is too late. ""It is also concerning that the government has noticed Dr. Williams as an expert to address the very issue that the Defendant Stewart raises in his motion in limine regarding evidence of deaths and illnesses in the present case,"" Bondurant wrote. ""It is not the role of the Defendant in the case to apprise the government of the government's failure to designate experts to establish the elements of the offense, but that is precisely what the government seeks to do here: the government waited for the Defendant to make his argument in his motion in limine and then seeks to repair the defects in the government's case by noticing Dr. Williams after the fact."" Bondurant says that having Williams testifying as an expert witness would be ""highly prejudicial"" and, because of the late notice, there is no way for the defense ""to adequately explore and potentially challenge the qualifications of Dr. Williams."" The defense team for the former PCA chief executive also wants Judge Sands to order the government to ""cease and desist"" from ""all efforts to obtain documents or information"" from former attorneys for the peanut company. At least one unnamed former law firm for PCA was contacted by letter on June 6, 2014, by the U.S. Department of Justice's Consumer Protection Branch, which is assisting in the prosecution, and ordered to provide ""all PCA and PCA related documents"" to the U.S. Attorneys Office in Albany, GA. The letter also warns the law firm ""not to destroy, conceal or alter"" any of the documents. Bondurant charges that the government's trial counsel ""has directly contacted and may have already received information that may be privileged from PCA's former attorneys in this case."" The defense wants the court to order the government attorneys to stop what it is doing until a DOJ ""taint team"" can be deployed to review potentially privileged materials before they can be turned over to prosecutors. Such a team was apparently used earlier in the case. While the defense argues that documents held by previous PCA attorneys may be covered by ""attorney-client"" or work product privileges, the issue is complicated by the fact that those protections were waived in 2011 during the bankruptcy court proceedings that liquidated the company. Meanwhile, Michael Parnell's defense team, from Athens, GA-based Cook Noell Tolley &amp; Bates LLP, is taking exception to how the government has depicted their client's role in PCA's activities. ""Michael Parnell was not a 'supervisor, advisor, and director of PCA,' as the government contends, and he did not give direction and receive information 'regarding all aspects of PCA's production of peanut paste,'"" writes defense attorney Edward D. Tolley. ""Michael Parnell was Vice President of his and his wife's brokerage business and his connection to this case arises from his relationship with Kelloggs out of Cary, North Carolina,"" Tolley adds. Tolley did not provide further explanation. Michael Parnell has also been previously identified as PCA's peanut broker. Defense attorneys are also challenging the government's plan to introduce microbiological testing for PCA by private laboratories and by state and federal governments during the outbreak investigation as routine business records. Tolley calls this ""nontestimonial heresay"" because it would not require the government to call experts who actually conducted the tests. ""Both the private laboratory records and the records from federal and state agencies are testimonial because they are offered for the truth of the matter asserted,"" the defense writes. Only through cross-examination can the reliability of the records be tested, they argue. The government's claims that PCA's peanut processing plant in Blakely, GA, was the ""likely"" source of the contamination is even a bigger concern for Michael Parnell's defense team. ""'Likely' is simply not good enough: the Government has to prove PCA Blakely as the source beyond a reasonable doubt,"" Tolley says."" He also says ""any investigation into the outbreak of a potential foodborne illness is also an investigation into potential criminal conduct ..."" The government has called the prosecution of foodborne illness outbreaks ""somewhat unusual."" The two Parnells and Wilkerson were among those named in a February 2013 indictment charging 76 federal felony counts, including fraud and conspiracy, involving the business operations of the Virginia-based peanut processing company with plants in Blakely, GA and Plainview, TX.

From the end of August, 42 people have been registered with shigellosis in the country. The outbreak is being investigated to try to pinpoint the source of infection and help stop it with experts doing final traceback investigations ahead of plans to reveal results next week. From Aug. 25 to Sept. 10, 42 cases of shigellosis were reported to the Statens Serum Institut (SSI). Patients are 26 women and 15 men aged 0 to 75 years old. The median age is 29 years old. A total of 13 people have been hospitalized. Most live in Hovestaden, while four cases have been reported in Sjaelland and two in Midtjylland. Investigating to find the sourceInterviews with those affected showed they had not been traveling in the period before they became ill. Shigella is not widespread in Denmark and is most often acquired because of travel abroad. Shigella sonnei has been isolated from 10 outbreak patients and whole genome sequencing shows closely related isolates. The other 31 patients are PCR-positive for the ipaH gene, which is a marker for all Shigella species and enteroinvasive E. coli. Previous outbreaks in Denmark include one in 2007, when more than 210 people became ill from eating contaminated imported baby corn. There were also 12 cases in Queensland, Australia. Infections were linked to a common baby corn packing house in Thailand. Another outbreak in 2009 involved 10 people and was traced to fresh, raw sugar peas (sugar snaps) imported from Kenya. Later that year, Norwegian officials identified four illnesses and five suspected cases that were linked. Most people infected with Shigella develop diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps starting a day or two after they are exposed to the bacteria. Shigellosis usually resolves in five to seven days but some people may experience symptoms from a few days to four or more weeks. People who are in poor health or who have weakened immune systems are more likely to get sick for a longer period of time if they have shigellosis. Meanwhile, a Hepatitis A outbreak investigation is still ongoing with no firm hypothesis of the source. It now includes 16 patients, up from 14 people aged 17 to 63 in the previous update. Eleven people have needed hospital treatment. Interviews have shown patients have not been traveling, do not know each other and they had not participated in joint events.

There is no word on FDA's response to the request, which was made available to the Houston Chronicle under a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) submittal. Attorney Joseph Levitt made the request to FDA on behalf of Blue Bell. The company contends it is losing millions of dollars worth of ice cream because of a requirement that it must destroy products that have preliminary positive test results for pathogens. ""What we are asking the FDA to do is release us from having to destroy product based on preliminary finished product testing in favor of validated and confirmed finished product testing that is more in line with the industry norm,"" according to a statement from the company. ""Blue Bell wants to limit the destruction of products to only those that have confirmed positive for a contaminant."" In 2015, Blue Bell was linked to a deadly five-year, multi-state Listeria outbreak, which forced it to remove its iconic brand of ice cream from grocery freezer spaces and close its three production facilities. Questions of what and when Blue Bell knew also attracted the interest of the U.S. Department of Justice over possible federal criminal charges. Things did not exactly go smoothly for Brenham, TX-based Blue Bell this year either. Early in 2016, Bell Blue reported Listeria will always be a threat. Company officials said their new cleaning, sanitizing and testing programs are keeping their customers as safe as possible, though. Texas officials imposed a fine and put Blue Bell on a short leash in July 2016. An agreement between Blue Bell and the Texas State Department of Health Services required the company to pay $175,000 within 30 days of the signing of the agreement. Another $675,000 -- for a total fine of $850,000 -- must be ""held in abeyance"" and would go to the state if Blue Bell fails to meet food safety requirements in the coming 18 months. Two months after signing the agreement with Texas, Blue Bell was again recalling ice cream because of potential Listeria contamination, but this time blaming cookie dough from a supplier as the source. That claim turned out to be true and cookie dough producer Aspen Hills Inc. of Garner, IA, recalled its dough, triggering a series of secondary recalls of other products.

According to Mayor Kelly Yaede and the Hamilton Township Division of Health, a series of tests conducted at Robert Wood Johnson Hospital - Hamilton determined that the second individual highlighted in earlier media reports was not infected with Hepatitis A. After a first blood test (that was eventually deemed to be a ""false positive"" result), two separate tests conducted by the hospital's emergency room staff, in consultation with their infectious disease team, came back as negative (indicating that the patient did not have Hepatitis A). Therefore, at this time, the only confirmed individual in this case determined to have Hepatitis A is the original employee of Rosa's Restaurant and Catering. The township has set up a makeshift clinic to administer Hepatitis A vaccines inside the Colonial Volunteer Fire Company. Any residents who ate at Rosa's Restaurant and Catering in Hamilton between Nov. 10 and Dec. 1 are being encouraged to get vaccinated.   Health officer Jeff Plunkett said that the employee was hospitalized last week. He added that the virus can be spread to others for two weeks before a person develops symptoms and for a week after that. Anyone who ate at, or had catered food from, the restaurant between Nov. 10 and Dec. 1 could be at risk for Hepatitis A if they have not been previously vaccinated. ""It is contagious through the oral route when you ingest food so it's a possibility that ... you could contract the virus if he was handling your food at the time,"" Plunkett said. Unvaccinated individuals who ate at the restaurant should receive an injection of immune globulin or Hepatitis A vaccine. Both can prevent an infection if given within 14 days of exposure. Starting Tuesday morning, Dec. 2, Hamilton residents can contact the township's health division at (609) 890-3884. Uninsured Hamilton residents may call the health division for an appointment. Anyone who ate at the Hamilton restaurant who has concerns or develops symptoms should call a doctor, officials said. The symptoms of Hepatitis A include mild fever, loss of appetite, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and dark urine and jaundice. Mild cases of Hepatitis A can last two weeks or less, while more severe cases can last four to six weeks.

Two-thirds ate a traditional dish made with fermented, uncooked fish before becoming sick. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (Folkehelseinstituttet) said most cases are more than 70 years old and have compromised immune systems. The agency is investigating the increase as an outbreak but not all cases are part of it. Eight cases ate rakfisk before they fell ill. This is a traditional seasonal Norwegian fish dish made from trout or char, salted and then fermented for up to a year before being eaten without cooking. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health said Listeria has been detected in rakfisk produced by Slidre Orretsenter, which is the suspected source of the outbreak. Slidre Orretsenter has withdrawn all varieties of rakfisk from the market. They were distributed and sold all over the country. The company asked people who bought the products to throw them away or take them back to the store where they were purchased. Rakfisk is a seasonal item and production is not going on now, according to the manufacturer. Officials at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said there was a ""strong suspicion"" that rakfisk caused the outbreak and emphasized that people in risk groups such as pregnant women, those with impaired immune systems, and the elderly should avoid eating rakfisk and other products at risk of Listeria contamination including items made from unpasteurized milk, soft and semi-soft cheeses, smoked salmon and sliced cooked meats. The agency received the reports of people with listeriosis from mid-November 2018 through the second week of January this year. Most of them live in Hedmark, Oppland and Buskerud. Usually, the country only has one to two patients are reported monthly. Last month, The Norwegian Institute of Public Health reported an increase in Listeria monocytogenes cases with six people affected in December. The agency started the outbreak investigations with the municipal health services, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (Mattilsynet) and Veterinary Institute. Laboratory testing is continuing and bacteria with similar DNA profiles have been detected in eight of the patients, meaning they were likely infected by a common source. Bacterial isolates from three of the 13 patients have other DNA profiles and do not belong to the outbreak. Typing of the remaining bacterial strains is ongoing. The municipal health service and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority has interviewed patients and collected food samples for analysis. Food tests are analyzed at the Veterinary Institute while information from interviews is compiled at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Mattilsynet is carrying out further investigations with the manufacturer. Samples of rakfisk were taken from one of the infected people and analyzed by the Veterinary Institute. Information for potential patientsFood contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes may not look or smell spoiled but can still cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections. Anyone who has eaten any of the recalled product and developed symptoms of Listeria infection should seek medical treatment and tell their doctors about the possible Listeria exposure. Also, anyone who has eaten any of the recalled product should monitor themselves for symptoms during the coming weeks because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to Listeria for symptoms of listeriosis to develop. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, their infections can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth.   Symptoms of Listeria infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache and neck stiffness. Specific laboratory tests are required to diagnose Listeria infections, which can mimic other illnesses.   (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

A cold, processed meat product made by South Africa's biggest producer of consumer foods is the cause of the ongoing outbreak, which has a stunning 27 percent fatality rate. Dr. Aaron Motsoaledi, South Africa's Minister of Health, on Sunday announced the source of the outbreak was two unrelated brands of ""polony"" manufactured by the Tiger Brands unit of Enterprise Foods and Rainbow Chicken Limited (RCL). The minister said the Enterprise and RCL polony products are being recalled, and he went further. ""We advise members of the public to avoid all processed meat products that are sold as ready-to-eat,"" Motsoaledi said. The risk of cross-contamination is why South Africa issued the broader public warning. ""While we know that polony is definitely implicated, there is a risk of cross-contamination of other ready-to-eat processed meat products, either at production, distribution or retail,"" according to the minister's statement. ""This is because Listeria on the exterior casing (packaging) of polony can be transferred to other products it comes into contact with, including viennas, russians, frankfurters, other sausages, and other 'cold meat' products that are typically not cooked before eating."" Motsoaledi said South Africa ""can now conclude scientifically that the source of the present outbreak is the Enterprise Food production facility located in Polokwane."" Ironically, Polokwane means ""Place of Safety."" The city is the capital of South Africa's Limpopo province. Enterprise's production plant in Polokwane returned at least 16 samples that tested positive for the Listeria monocytogenes outbreak strain known as ST6. Preliminary results on samples from other Enterprise plants also show Listeria contamination, but the strains have not been confirmed. South Africa's National Consumer Commission ordered Enterprise to recall all of its polony, smoked russians, frankfurters, and Rainbow brand chicken products. Enterprise says it is cooperating fully. Meanwhile, RCL says it is suspending all production of its Rainbow polony brand. An RCL production facility is under investigation in the Listeria probe. After the health minister's announcement, many South African supermarkets moved immediately to remove any suspect ready-to-eat meats from their coolers. ""In our constant search for the source of the outbreak and the treatment of people who are affected, a team from NICD (National Institute for Communicable Diseases) has interviewed 109 ill people to obtain details about foods they had eaten in the month before falling ill,"" Motsoaledi said Sunday. It can take up to 70 days after exposure for listeriosis symptoms to develop. Of the victims who have been interviewed, 93 of them, representing 85 percent, remember eating ready-to-eat (RTE) processed meat products. Polony was the most commonly named processed meat product, followed by Vienna/sausages and other ""cold meats."" South Africa began investigating the outbreak on Jan. 12 after a pediatrician treating nine children younger than 5 at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital suspected a foodborne disease was involved, including listeriosis. By Jan. 27, NICD had found the same Listeria monocytogenes ST6 strain in Enterprise and RCL products as had been found in stool samples from the ill children. Motsoaledi said it was at that stage of the investigation that officials decided to ""visit all food-processing sites, food-packaging sites as well as food production sites where possible."" The health minister said preliminary results show several ready-to-eat processed meat products from the Enterprise facility located in Germiston contain Listeria monocytogenes, but the sequence type isn't yet known. At the RCL Wolwehoek production facility, polony products tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes, but not ST6. ""However, such contamination of ready-to-eat processed meat products constitutes a health risk,"" said Motsoaledi. Sunday's public health warning and the ready-to-eat meat recalls will likely begin to contain the outbreak, but only time will tell how quickly that occurs. Lucia Anelich, a microbiologist and prominent South African food safety expert, said it is the worst foodborne outbreak ""in global history."" As of March 2, South Africa's count of laboratory-confirmed Listeria infections since January 2017 stood at 948. A total of 659 patients involve the outbreak strain, and 180 of those died, constituting a 27 percent fatality rate. Except for the much higher numbers, South Africa's listeria outbreak is eerily similar to Canada's experience in 2008. That listeriosis outbreak caused 22 deaths of mostly elderly Canadians. It involved one of Canada's most prominent and respected food companies, Maple Leaf Foods of Toronto accepted responsibility. The fatality rate was 40 percent. Maple Leaf found mechanical meat slicers at its ready-to-eat meat plant spread the bacteria across Canada. The problem was a design flaw that inhibited thorough cleaning. That outbreak also led to Canada accepting 57 food safety recommendations from food safety expert Sheila Weatherill, who conducted an independent investigation. Maple Leaf CEO Michael McCain praised the Weatherill report as exceptionally thorough and comprehensive. (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

And there is no report of any U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigator holding up a ""smoking"" cucumber or being on Mexican soil. Nevertheless, last year's multi-state outbreak of Salmonella infections linked to cucumbers from Mexico was declared over on March 18. Since the last update on Jan. 26, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said an additional 19 people were added to the outbreak from eight states. The CDC final report says 907 people were infected with the outbreak strains of Salmonella in 40 states. Among these, at least 204 hospitalizations and 6 deaths were associated with the outbreak. The Salmonella Poona outbreak first came to light last Sept. 4 with CDC's initial announcement. Through epidemiological, laboratory and traceback investigations, state and federal investigators identified cucumbers imported from Mexico and distributed by Andrew &amp; Williamson Fresh Produce as the likely source of the outbreak infections. Two recalls by Andrew &amp; Williamson Fresh Produce followed in September for cucumbers over possible Salmonella contamination. CDC says no other food was associated with the outbreak, but the source of the contamination for the cucumbers distributed by Andrews &amp; Williamson has not been identified. The CDC final report is silent on whether any U.S. government officials did any on the ground investigations in Mexico. CDC credits public health officials from ""many states and the U.S., Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for conducting the months-long investigation. The peak of the Salmonella Poona illnesses occurred last September-October. The FDA traceback investigation did determined that the firm Rancho Don Juanito de R.L. de C.V. located in Baja, Mexico was the primary source of cucumbers shipped to Andrew &amp; Williamson.

The two botulism cases in Orange County are not believed to be related to another cluster of botulism cases in Sacramento County that have been linked to gas station food in Walnut Grove, CA. ""CDPH (California Department of Public Health) is investigating two possible cases of botulism in Orange County residents, both of whom consumed U.S. Deer Antlers Exports and Imports Inc. herbal tea products in March,"" according to Monday's warning from the state health department about the tea, which is packaged in plastic pouches. A recall notice dated March 4 and posted on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration website reported the implicated tea was distributed to individual customers and acupuncturists in California, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia. Anyone who has consumed any of the recalled tea produces by U.S. Deer Antlers Exports and Imports Inc. and developed symptoms of botulism poisoning should immediately seek medical attention. ""Initial symptoms frequently include double or blurred vision, drooping eyelids, and dry or sore throat. Progressive descending paralysis, usually symmetrical, may follow,"" according to the California health department warning. ""Additional symptoms may include slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, inability of the neck muscles to support the head and paralysis of the extremities and respiratory muscles."" Caused by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, botulism toxin is odorless and colorless, making it undetectable in foods and beverages. Simply handling the recalled tea could result in exposure to toxins from the bacterium, according to public health officials. Consumers who have any of the tea, or any foods made with it, should discard it immediately by double bagging it in tightly closed plastic bags and placing them in non-recyclable trash bins outside of the home. People should wear rubber or latex gloves, if possible, when handling potentially contaminated products or wash their hands with soap and running water for at least two minutes after touching potentially contaminated foods or beverages. ""Consumers who find the product being offered for sale are encouraged to report the activity to the CDPH toll-free complaint line at 800-495-3232,"" according to the California state warning.

The recalled tahini is linked to a Salmonella Concord outbreak that has sickened people in at least three states, according to the alert issued May 15 by the Food and Drug Administration. In that alert federal officials said they had ""requested"" that the product be recalled. Public health officials are concerned that consumers, restaurants and other entities may have the recalled tahini products on hand. The products have expiration dates two years from the date of production, raising additional concerns that people may have the product on shelves in homes and commercial kitchens and not know about the recall. The four outbreak patients confirmed as of May 15 live in New York, Massachusetts and Texas. One person has required hospitalization. No deaths have been reported. The FDA reported that the current outbreak is not related to a 2017-2018 outbreak traced to other imported tahini products. The importerm Broddzenatti Holding LLC of Jupiter, FL, distributed the recalled Karawan brand tahini to distributors in New York, Massachusetts, Virginia and Texas. Those distributors sent the product to retailers that have not been named by the FDA. Consumers can identify the recalled tahini by looking for the following information on the 16-ounce jars and 39-pound buckets of the product: Broddzenatti Holding imported the tahini from Palestine between December 2018 and January 2019, according to the company's recall notice posted today by the FDA. Broddzenatti Holding LLC has ceased the importation and distribution of the product. ""This recall has been initiated due to New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene laboratory results from two samples of Karawan brand tahini testing positive for Salmonella,"" according to the recall notice. ""Consumers who have purchased Karawan brand tahini are urged to destroy it or return it to the place of purchase for a full refund."" Consumers with questions may contact Broddzenatti Holding LLC at 305-570-9050. Yesterday's tahini alertOn May 15, the FDA reported the tahini implicated in the current outbreak is imported from Israel. The public alert said several companies could be involved, but ""Brodt Zenatti Holdings LLC"" of Jupiter, FL, had been identified as one importer of the product. The FDA alert said the tahini of concern may be labelled as either ""Karawan Tahini"" or as ""El Karawan Tahini."" ""The FDA has been working with the state of New York and New York City. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene tested samples of Karawan tahini and found that the product contained Salmonella,"" according to the FDA's outbreak investigation report. ""Based on the positive product sample, the available epidemiological data, and traceback data from the investigation, the FDA has requested that the product be voluntarily recalled.  ""Discussions with the U.S. agent for the firm, as well as foreign public health partners are ongoing and additional information will be provided as it becomes available."" Tahini is made from sesame seeds and can be served on its own or used as an ingredient in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern style dishes, such as hummus, falafel and baba ganoush. Importers sold the suspect tahini in bulk to retailers and restaurants, as well as in consumer packaging that is available at retail locations and online.  ""It may have also been used in other food products sold to consumers. Consumers should be aware that this product has a shelf life of two years and should check their homes for tahini with either label,"" the FDA warned. ""Consumers with concerns about tahini consumed outside the home should ask their restaurant or retailer if the product they have purchased contains this tahini. Retailers and restaurants should throw the product out and sanitize any surfaces that may have come in contact with this tahini."" Symptoms of Salmonella infectionFood that is contaminated with Salmonella bacteria usually does not look, smell or taste spoiled. Anyone can become sick with a Salmonella infection, but infants, children, seniors and people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of serious illness because their immune systems are fragile, according to the CDC. Anyone who has eaten any of the recalled products and developed symptoms of Salmonella infection should seek medical attention. Sick people should tell their doctors about the possible exposure to Salmonella bacteria because special tests are necessary to diagnose salmonellosis. Salmonella infection symptoms can mimic other illnesses, frequently leading to misdiagnosis. Symptoms of Salmonella infection can include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating contaminated food. Otherwise healthy adults are usually sick for four to seven days. In some cases, however, diarrhea may be so severe that patients need to be hospitalized.  Older adults, children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients, are more likely to develop a severe illness and serious, sometimes life-threatening conditions. It is possible for some people to be infected with the bacteria and to not get sick or show any symptoms, but to still be able to spread the infection to others. Instructions for consumers, restaurants and retailersIn the event that retailers and/or other food service operators are found to have or handled Karawan tahini or other potentially contaminated food in their facilities, the FDA instructed them to discard it and tae the following action: Consumerswho think they might have become ill from eating possibly contaminated tahini should talk to their health care providers. The FDA advised that anyone who has or had the tahini in their homes should take these steps for preventing foodborne illness: Consumers can also submit a voluntarily report, a complaint, or adverse event (illness or serious allergic reaction) related to a food product.

The E. coli O157:H7 outbreak sickened at least 42 people who developed infections from the contaminated pork, according to Alberta Health Services. Thirteen people were so sick they were admitted to hospitals. One of them died, likely because of the infection, health officials reported.  The Meat Shop at Pine Haven sold the pork products to restaurants, grocery stores and other entities in Canada. An ensuing series of at least six pork recalls involved dozens of products packaged under various brands. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency posted the recalls, which began April 24 and continued through May 2.  ""While this outbreak is considered over, there is still the possibility there may be additional cases confirmed in the coming weeks, which is why we ask people to check their freezers, to make sure they don't still have products affected by the recalls,"" said the Friday statement from the Alberta health department. Dr. Jasmine Hasselback, medical officer of health for Edmonton Zone of Alberta Health Services praised the meat business in the Friday update.  ""We would also like to thank and acknowledge The Meat Shop at Pine Haven and all of the affected businesses for their cooperation,"" Hasselback said in the  outbreak update. Alberta health officials began an investigating a cluster of confirmed cases of E. coli on March 29. Three and a half weeks later, on April 24, the outbreak was linked to certain pork products sold and distributed by The Meat Shop at Pine Haven.  Initially officials thought the outbreak was linked to Mama Nita's Filipino Cuisine restaurant. However, it was later confirmed that the restaurant had purchased pork products from The Meat Shop. The operators deep cleaned and sanitized the restaurant. In addition to Alberta investigators, staff from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, the Public Health Agency of Canada and Health Canada, worked on the investigation. Advice to consumersAnyone who has recently eaten any of the recalled products listed on the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's website and developed symptoms of E. coli infection should immediately seek medical attention. People should make sure their doctors know about their possible exposure so the proper diagnostic testing and treatment can be provided.  Symptoms usually begin one to eight days after ingesting the bacteria. Symptoms can include diarrhea that can range from mild and watery to severe and bloody; abdominal cramping, pain or tenderness; nausea; and vomiting in some people. Healthy adults usually recover from E. coli O157:H7 infections within a week.

April 20 through May 2 were the illness onset dates for the Minnesota illnesses, according to the statement from the Minnesota Departments of Health (MDH), and Agriculture (MDA). The Minnesota officials said the 10 confirmed cases ""have been recently identified and linked to the multi-state outbreak."" The cases are from both Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area and greater Minnesota counties; 90 percent are female. Three people have been hospitalized. Two developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a potentially fatal complication that can include kidney failure and other severe problems. All of the sick people in Minnesota who have been interviewed by public health investigators reported exposure to romaine lettuce. They said they ate romain from grocery stores, at restaurants and residential facilities. Both MDH and MDA are continuing to investigate. The last national count on May 1 reported 121 confirmed cases and one death with 25 states included in the outbreak, according to the CDC. Fifty-two have required hospitalization. With North Dakota and Minnesota now reporting confirmed cases, there are 27 states involved in the outbreak. ""Do not eat, buy, or sell romaine lettuce unless you can confirm it is not from the Yuma growing region,"" said Kirk Smith, manager of Minnesota's Foodborne, Waterborne, Vectorborne, and Zoonotic Diseases section. ""The Yuma growing region includes part of western Arizona and extends into the Imperial Valley of southeastern California, but does not include Salinas Valley or other growing regions in California."" Romaine from the Yuma growing region should no longer be on sale; however, individuals should check their refrigerators for romaine lettuce grown earlier in season in the Yuma region. Symptoms of illness caused by E. coli O157 typically include stomach cramps and diarrhea, often with bloody stools, but only a low-grade or no fever. People typically become ill two to five days after exposure, but this period can range from one to eight days. Most people recover in five to 10 days. However, E. coli O157 infections sometimes lead to HUS. Those most at risk of developing complications from E. coli O157 include children younger than 10, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems. Diarrhea associated with E. coli O157 infections should not be treated with antibiotics, as this practice might promote the development of HUS. Anyone who believes they may have developed an E. coli O157 infection should contact their healthcare provider. Approximately 135 cases of E. coli O157 are reported each year in Minnesota.

An outbreak traced to the vegetables from Greenyard Frozen has sickened 47 people in five European countries. Nine people have died. Greenyard, a producer of fresh, frozen and prepared fruits and vegetables linked to the outbreak, has estimated the cost of the recall at $35 million (EUR30 million). Company officials said that includes costs for the product, transportation, handling, storage, destruction, subcontracting, lower cost absorption of the factory, and loss of margin. The company is insured for recall costs and possible product liability damages.  Due to the scale of the situation, the European Commission and the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN), which is managed by the Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization, are involved. A spokesman for INFOSAN said 107 countries and territories received implicated products.  ""Some countries have re-exported some of the products imported to other countries. Some have received and reprocessed original products into other products under different brands. All this is contributing to making the traceability and recalls more complex,"" he told Food Safety News. ""The genetic sequence of the Listeria strain involved has also been shared with members of the network to facilitate the investigation of listeriosis cases detected in individual countries and see if they can be linked or not to this outbreak by comparing their genetic sequences with the outbreak strain.""

However, because the person died, public health officials cannot confirm whether the victim ate the implicated frozen vegetables before becoming ill. Listeria monocytogenes IVb sequence type (ST) 6 that matches the outbreak strain from victims was isolated from frozen spinach and frozen green beans sampled at the facility. It was also isolated in a sample from a floor drain at the packaging area confirming the environmental contamination of the Hungarian processing plant. ""We have closed our plant in Hungary and have been conducting an in-depth review of the plant with a view to identifying the root cause of the contamination in full cooperation with the respective authorities and in dialogue with the customer,"" according to a statement from Greenyard officials. ""We will not restart production in our Hungarian facility until we are fully satisfied with the results of these tests, for which we are working in continuous cooperation and consultation with the local authorities, and following the European guidelines.""

It's called the Foodborne Outbreak Online Database Tool (FOOD Tool) and, on Tuesday, the agency revealed a shiny new version. Originally developed in 2009, the FOOD Tool includes both single and multistate foodborne outbreak data reported to CDC from 1998 to 2014. It originally only let users sift through the data by state, where the food was consumed, and the pathogen responsible. In addition to the ability to search by food item or ingredient, the updated tool now includes interactive maps and graphs. Users looking for the more traditional table of data can still access it in the Tabular View.  FOOD Tool's data come from CDC's Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System (FDOSS), which captures information on foodborne outbreaks caused by enteric bacterial, viral, parasitic, and chemical agents reported by state, local, and territorial public health agencies. CDC analyzes the data (more detailed than what are presented in the public tool) to understand the impact of foodborne outbreaks and the causes or contributing factors, such as food kept at room temperature for too long. CDC states that the database is for reporters and members of the public to understand the history of recent or ongoing outbreaks of foodborne illness.

Advice to consumersAnyone who has eaten any of the recalled products and developed symptoms of Salmonella infection should seek medical attention and tell their doctors about the possible exposure to the bacteria. Anyone can become sick with a Salmonella infection, but infants, children, seniors and those with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of serious illness because their immune systems are more fragile, according to the state health agency. Most people who become ill from a Salmonella infection will recover fully after a few days. It is possible for some people to be infected with the bacteria and not get sick or show any symptoms, but still be able to spread the infection to others. Symptoms of a Salmonella infection, called salmonellosis, typically start 6 to 72 hours after exposure to Salmonella bacteria, but in some people it takes two weeks for symptoms to develop. Symptoms include fever, chills, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, headache, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms usually last for four to seven days.

State officials issued a public health alert about the dairy's raw milk products Friday in connection with an investigation into foodborne illnesses, according to the alert from the Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA). ""This alert is the result of an investigation by ODA and the Ohio Department of Health after foodborne illnesses were reported in Franklin County. Later testing confirmed a connection between the illnesses and raw milk from Sweet Grass Dairy,"" according to the alert. People can prevent such infections by consuming only pasteurized milk and milk products, the alert states. Pasteurization is the process in which milk is heated briefly to kill any pathogenic bacteria that might be present. Raw milk has not been pasteurized to kill pathogenic bacteria and is not legally available for sale in Ohio retail stores. The Sweet Grass Dairy is in Fredericktown, which is in Knox County, and is owned by Jacob Coleman. He provided a statement to KnoxPages.com, contending all food carries the risk of pathogens.

Anyone who has consumed raw milk or raw milk products from Sweet Grass Dairy and developed symptoms of Campylobacter infection should seek medical attention and inform their doctors about their possible exposure. Symptoms can include diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, nausea and vomiting within two to five days after exposure to the organism. Illness can last for up to a week or more and can be especially severe for those who have weakened or compromised immune systems, and for young children and the elderly.

The CDC also confirmed the first outbreak-related death today. Since the initial outbreak report on July 19 -- when 90 people from 26 states had been confirmed with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Reading -- another 74 people have been added to the case count. As of Nov. 5, 164 people from 35 states are laboratory confirmed as outbreak patients, according to this afternoon's update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. No recalls have been initiated in relation to the outbreak. The outbreak's hospitalization rate is higher than usually seen with salmonellosis. Of the 135 patients with the information currently available, 47 percent have been admitted to hospitals. One of the patients in California died.  ""In interviews, ill people report eating different types and brands of turkey products purchased from many different locations. Three ill people lived in households where raw turkey pet food was fed to pets,"" said investigators from the CDC. ""The outbreak strain of Salmonella Reading has been identified in samples from raw turkey pet food in Minnesota, from live turkeys from several states, and from raw turkey products collected from ill people's homes. The raw turkey samples collected from ill people's homes are still being investigated to determine the source of the turkey. A single, common supplier of raw turkey products or of live turkeys has not been identified."" The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service has food safety jurisdiction over poultry and its investigators are working with the CDC and turkey producers, but the FSIS is deferring to the CDC when it comes to outbreak updates.  Federal food safety officials say the fact that the outbreak strain of Salmonella Reading is present in live turkeys and many types of raw turkey products show the bacteria could be widespread in the turkey industry.  ""CDC and USDA-FSIS have shared this information with representatives from the turkey industry and asked about steps that they may be taking to reduce Salmonella contamination,"" according to the CDC update. Routine government testing detected an outbreakInspectors from FSIS who were conducting routine testing discovered Salmonella contamination in turkey products from 22 slaughter facilities and seven processing establishments. They performed whole genome sequencing on the bacteria samples and uploaded the results to the CDC's pathogen database. Cross checks of isolates from infected people showed the Salmonella Reading strain detected in the slaughter and processing plants had the same DNA fingerprint. The first patient with an infection from the outbreak became ill on Nov. 20, 2017, with the most recent documented illness beginning on Oct. 20 this year. The confirmed patients range in age from less than 1 year old to 91 years old.  State and local health department investigators continue to interview ill people about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Of 85 patients for whom the information is available, more than half -- 44 -- reported eating or handling raw turkey products before becoming sick. Three of those 85 worked in a facility that raises or processes turkeys or lived with someone who did. Health officials say some of the specific isolates of the outbreak strains are proving difficult to treat. The CDC is encouraging medical providers to review its information on antibiotic resistance among the bacteria causing the infections.  ""Whole genome sequencing showed 68 isolates from ill people and 84 isolates from food, animal, and environmental samples contained genes for resistance to all or some of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, kanamycin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and fosfomycin,"" according to the CDC. ""Testing of five outbreak isolates using standard antibiotic susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory confirmed these results. Most of the infections in this outbreak are susceptible to the antibiotics that are commonly used for treatment, so this resistance likely will not affect the choice of antibiotic used to treat most people."" Advice for consumersFood that is contaminated with Salmonella bacteria usually does not look, smell or taste spoiled. Anyone can become sick with a Salmonella infection, but infants, children, seniors and people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of serious illness because their immune systems are fragile, according to the CDC. Anyone who has eaten any of the recalled products and developed symptoms of Salmonella infection should seek medical attention. Sick people should tell their doctors about the possible exposure to Salmonella bacteria because special tests are necessary to diagnose salmonellosis. Salmonella infection symptoms can mimic other illnesses, frequently leading to misdiagnosis. Symptoms of Salmonella infection can include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating contaminated food. Otherwise healthy adults are usually sick for four to seven days. In some cases, however, diarrhea may be so severe that patients need to be hospitalized.  Older adults, children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients, are more likely to develop a severe illness and serious, sometimes life-threatening conditions. It is possible for some people to be infected with the bacteria and to not get sick or show any symptoms, but to still be able to spread the infection to others.

Before the end came, infections of E. coli O157: H7 in 217 people saw every other person admitted to the hospital. Unlike other romaine-linked E. coli outbreaks since late 2017, there were no deaths during this round. The largest outbreak this time involved E. coli infections linked to romaine lettuce grown in California's Salinas Valley. It ended up sickening 167 people with the outbreak strain of E. coli O157: H7 in 27 states. The most recent illness onset date was Dec. 21, 2019. The next three outbreaks might be one. CDC includes the outbreak linked to Fresh Express Sunflower Crist Chopped Salad Kits as a multistate outbreak. The Fresh Express salad kits, containing romaine, had a best-before date of Dec. 7, 2019. Ten people in five states were infected. Fresh Express was further implicated in these events when the outbreak strain from the Salinas growing region showed up in an unopened bag of its Leafty Green Romaine. Wisconsin health officials made the discovery. The Public Health Agency of Canada also reports 24 cases across six Canadian provinces that are the third romaine/E. coli event. And the fourth involves 11 cases associated with romaine consumption at a Seattle area restaurant chain. FDA and CDC continue to treat the four events as separate outbreaks. If more traceback evidence existed, it might suggest otherwise. The federal food detectives were at a disadvantage because the outbreaks occurred after the Salinas growing season. ""When investigators arrived on the ranches, there was no romaine lettuce in the ground, and the fields had been plowed, as the growing season had already ended,"" FDA reports. ""Investigators collected water, soil, and compost samples to be analyzed,"" it said. ""So far, sample results have come back negative for the three outbreak strains of E. coli. FDA did find a strain of E. coli that is unrelated to any illnesses in a soil sample."" ""This strain of E. coli was determined to be of low risk to people,"" FDA continued. ""Although this grower was determined to be a common supplier for all three outbreaks based on available supply chain information, the romaine lettuce from this grower does not explain all the illnesses seen in the three outbreaks. FDA promises to keep investigating ""throughout this year's romaine lettuce planting, growing and harvesting seasons."" Those seasons essentially occur year-round, depending on the growing region. Fresh Express tells consumers that Traceability is No. 5 on its seven rules for food safety. ""Another important component of an effective food safety program is the ability to trace leafy greens products back to where they are grown and forward to where they are distributed. We use coordinated bar-code tracking technology that's second to none,"" Fresh Express says, ""Our extensive, fully integrated traceability system has been in place for many years."" The FDA finding a common grower is ""a notable development"" in that the best industry and government could do previously was to identify a suspected growing region. Also notable was 75,233-pound recall of salad products by Missa Bay LLC in Swedesboro, NJ. Those products contained lettuce from the same lot used in packaged salads containing E. coli O157: H7. Maryland health officials made that discovery and connected the dots. Except for that specific recall, the public was warned not to eat romaine lettuce that was either of unknown origin or from the Salinas growing region. The outbreak's end brings an end to those warnings as the government believes none of the suspect romaine remains on the market. (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

When the test results came in, prosecutors in West Ashley, SC, filed an additional charge of tampering with food products and Hang's bond was increased by another $100,000.

New research confirms dangers of eating placentasCelebrities like Nikki Reed aka vampire Rosalie Hale in ""The Twilight Saga"" have been fueling the trend of new mothers eating the placenta after giving birth, new research published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology says the practice is a food safety nightmare. Reed and other proponents of placenta eating, including Kim Kardashian, Blac Chyna, and January Jones, contend the practice can give new mothers energy, improve their milk production, and ease postpartum depression. The researchers said they couldn't find any evidence of those benefits. Instead they found that new mothers and their breastfed newborns are at risk of contracting life-threatening infections. That finding is in line with a warning in June this year from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That warning came after an Oregon mother had the placenta from her child dehydrated and capsulized by a company specializing in the process. The woman was taking the capsules like dietary supplements. Her newborn was in and out of hospitals with unresolved Group B Streptococcus agalactiae sepsis until the birth hospital notified an attending physician the woman had requested the placenta when she delivered. The growing popularity of placenta eating -- both in dehydrated form and prepared as fresh meat -- should be considered by physicians when they encounter new mothers or babies suffering from certain infections.

Everyone who ate at the Huddle House restaurant in Poplar Bluff, MO, between Jan. 3 and Jan. 17 is advised to ask their doctors about what post-exposure steps they can take to prevent illness. Huddle House customers who ate or drank anything from the restaurant during this time period should seek medical care if they have symptoms of hepatitis A. It can take up to 50 days for symptoms to develop. A post-exposure vaccine is available, but it is only effective if administered within two weeks of exposure, according to state and federal public health officials The restaurant operators are working with the Missouri Department of Health &amp; Senior Services and the Butler County Health Department to investigate the situation and are taking necessary control measures to decrease the spread of the illness. Previously, a case of Hepatitis A was identified in a food handler who worked while potentially contagious at a Huddle House restaurant in Dexter, MO. That restaurant's operators are also working with the state health department as well as the Stoddard County Health Center to investigate the situation. The restaurant management has taken necessary control measures to decrease the risk of spreading the illness, according to public health officials. Members of the public who ate at the Dexter, MO, Huddle House between Nov. 21, 2017, and Dec. 2, 2017, should watch for symptoms of hepatitis A and seek medical care if they have symptoms. Symptoms usually develop between two and seven weeks after exposure, according to the CDC, and can include: With concurrent outbreaks occurring across the nation, pre- and post exposure vaccines  are in limited supply. Therefore, their use has been restricted in some areas of the country, where people at highest risk for illness or complications are receiving treatment before otherwise healthy adults. One multi-state outbreak has sickened more than 1,200 people. Several restaurant employees in cities across the country have been confirmed with that outbreak strain, causing tens of thousands of people to seek post exposure treatment. Hepatitis A is a virus that infects the liver. Most people who get hepatitis A feel sick for several weeks, but they usually recover completely and do not have lasting liver damage. In rare cases, hepatitis A can cause liver failure and death; this is more common in people older than 50 and in people with other liver diseases. Hepatitis A is spread when a person swallows the virus, which can be present on objects or in food or drinks contaminated by microscopic amounts of feces from an infected person. The best way to keep from getting sick from hepatitis A is to get vaccinated. Hepatitis A vaccine is highly effective when administered properly. However, because vaccines may be limited at this time in some areas because of the nationwide outbreak, good hand washing practices are even more important than usual to prevent hepatitis A from spreading, according to advice from the CDC. Washing hands after going to the bathroom and changing diapers, as well as before preparing or eating food, can help keep the virus from spreading to uninfected people.

Before the epidemiologist's presentation to the Clark County, WA, health board on Wednesday, no agencies at the local, state or federal levels had gone public with any information on the outbreak, which is ongoing and has sickened at least 31 people in seven states from Hawaii to New Jersey. Representatives from both the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed Friday for Food Safety News that the federal agencies are involved in the outbreak investigation. Both said their respective agencies had not informed the public about the ongoing outbreak because they haven't found anything worth revealing. ""CDC is working with several states and FDA to investigate 31 infections of Salmonella Paratyphi B variant L (+) tartrate (+) infections reported from seven states,"" the CDC spokeswoman said. ""The investigation is ongoing and has not yet indicated a specific source of this outbreak. ""CDC communicates about an outbreak when we have actionable information we can give people to protect themselves. At this time, CDC does not have enough evidence to warrant issuing advice to the public for this outbreak."" Public health investigators in Washington and Oregon knew on Sept. 8 that 11 of 14 outbreak victims interviewed in their states had eaten sushi before becoming ill. Between the linesThe FDA didn't provide any new information Friday, except the fact that it has an open investigation into the outbreak. However, the FDA's statement in effect named the supplier of the implicated tuna, Relish Foods Inc., of Culver City, CA. ""(T)his is an ongoing investigation, and we, together with our federal, state and local partners, have not yet identified a source,"" according to the FDA statement. ""During our traceback investigation and sampling, we did collect product samples that were positive for Salmonella, but these are not related to the outbreak strain. ""We worked with the firm to help initiate a recall of the lots associated with positive product samples. Proactively, the firm recalled more product than just the lot associated with the positive samples."" Referred to Friday only as ""the firm"" in the FDA's statement, the agency posted a recall notice Oct. 19 from Relish Foods for tuna loins. This week Relish Foods expanded the recall to include more sizes of tuna loins, as well as tuna steaks. Both recall notices reported FDA testing returned positive results for Salmonella. Victim wasn't told about tunaThe FDA's statement Friday, pointing to the fact that its tests did not show the specific outbreak strain of Salmonella paratyphi, leaves out an important fact, according to Seattle food safety attorney Bill Marler. It's not unusual for a food product to be contaminated with more than one strain of any given bacteria, Marler said. The neutral spin from the agency on that point isn't as significant to the attorney as is the lack of transparency during the outbreak investigation. ""The fact that the public wasn't informed and this (news) came out this way at a county health board meeting is perplexing,"" Marler said Friday, ""especially when you look at the amount of work public health did, investigating the seafood company, etc."" Marler's law firm, Marler Clark LLC, is representing one of the outbreak victims, Crystal McIntyre. The Oregon woman became sick in August after eating tuna sushi at a Hana Sushi restaurant in Tigard, OR. She was infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella paratyphi, Marler said, and when public health officials were notified -- as is required by law for certain illnesses -- they interviewed her. ""Health officials interviewed her but didn't mention to her that tuna could be the source,"" Marler said. ""The information out of Clark County certainly confirms what the source was for our client."" The victim's lawsuit, filed in state Circuit Court in Oregon, names JL Hana Plus LLC doing business as Sushi Hana 10, and Sushi Hana LLC doing business as Sushi Hana LLC as defendants. McIntyre ate tuna sushi the Sushu Hana restaurant on Aug. 18. Oregon officials had test results Sept. 8 confirming 12 people in the state had infections from Salmonella paratyphi, all with the same DNA fingerprint as five people in Washington state. By Sept. 15, Oregon officials had positive test results for Salmonella from a specific tuna supplier, but they did not alert the public. The Oregon Department of Agriculture recommended that restaurants put a hold on tuna from that supplier.

Tuesday initiated a recall of some of its infant cereal because of excessive levels of arsenic. Also, the company will stop selling it, saying it may not be able to consistently abide by the guidance level in the future. Consumer Reports immediately praised the Beach-Nut recall announcement for the infant cereal because the levels of inorganic arsenic in it exceed the guidance level adopted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The limits are in place to protect infants and toddlers from exposure to arsenic. The recalled Beech-Nut Stage 1 Single Grain Rice cereal has a UPC number of 52200034705, an expiration date of 01 MAY 2022, and product codes 103470XXXX and 093470XXXX. The expiration date and product numbers can be found at the bottom of the Beech-Nut Single Rice Cereal canister. These specific product codes were distributed nationally through retail and online sales. ""The safety of infants and children is Beech-Nut's top priority,"" said Jason Jacobs, Beech-Nut vice president of food safety and quality. ""We are issuing this voluntary recall, because we learned through routine sampling by the State of Alaska that a limited quantity of Beech-Nut Single Grain Rice Cereal products had levels of naturally-occurring inorganic arsenic above the FDA guidance level, even though the rice flour used to produce these products tested below the FDA guidance level for inorganic arsenic,"" said Jason Jacobs, Vice President, Food Safety and Quality. No illnesses related to these product codes have been reported to date, and no other production dates or Beech-Nut products are affected by the recall. The recall follows the FDA guidance level limits on inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal set in August 2020.  There are no limits on arsenic in other baby foods or limits for other heavy metals, including cadmium, lead, and mercury despite the potential health risk to young children. Consumer Reports is calling on Congress to require the FDA to adopt strict limits by approving the Baby Food Safety Act of 2021. ""We've known for years that toxic heavy metals are found in popular baby foods and can lead to serious health problems in children over time,"" said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports. ""This recall underscores why we need strict limits to keep dangerous heavy metals out of the food that so many parents serve their young children every day. Congress should pass the Baby Food Safety Act so that the FDA can better protect vulnerable infants and toddlers from being exposed to toxic substances in the food they eat."" Ronholm is a former USDA deputy undersecretary for food safety. For more than a decade, Consumer Reports (CR) has called on the FDA to establish strict limits because its own tests and research by others has shown concerning levels of heavy metals in baby food that can pose serious health problems in children. In April, the FDA announced an action plan to reduce heavy metals in baby food, but the timeline for adopting limits would leave infants exposed to the higher levels of toxic substances for the next several years. It's unclear whether the plan will result in the kind of strict limits needed to protect children, according to Consumer Reports. Founded in 1936, the independent and nonprofit CR is one of the nation's oldest consumer groups. The Baby Food Safety Act of 2021 would require the FDA to establish aggressive limits for baby cereal and all other baby foods for cadmium, inorganic arsenic, lead and mercury. It would go into effect two years after the bill is signed into law. It has been introduced in Congress. The FDA  recognizes that trace elements such as these are widely present in the environment, including water, soil, and food and has also stated that exposure to elevated levels of naturally occurring inorganic arsenic can pose a health hazard to young children.

Improper food handling practices that could contribute to the spread of norovirus, including insufficient temperatures for the dishwashing machine, improper handwashing were observed, inadequate use of barriers to prevent bare hand contact with ready-to-eat foods, and risk of cross-contamination. The restaurant closed on Aug. 5 to complete a thorough cleaning and disinfection. All ready-to-eat foods processed before the restaurant was disinfected were discarded. Environmental Health investigators revisited the restaurant and confirmed proper cleaning and disinfection was completed and that the observed improper food handling practices were corrected. The restaurant was reopened on Aug. 6, 2021.

The bacteria can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in humans. The recall was initiated after routine testing by the Washington State Department of Agriculture revealed the presence of Listeria monocytogenes in a package of the pet food, and is being carried out with the knowledge of the Food and Drug Administration. There is concern that pet owners could expose themselves by handling the recalled pet food and utensils and bowls used for it. Pet owners can also easily cross contaminate counters, floors and other surfaces when handling and serving the pet food. The recalled pet food was processed on Aug. 19, 2017. It was packaged frozen in 2-pound plastic bags with ""Lot 81917"" on the labels. It was distributed in Alaska, Oregon and Washington through retail stores and direct delivery to the public. Pets who become infected with Listeria monocytogenes may develop symptoms that include mild to severe diarrhea, anorexia, fever, nervous, muscular and respiratory signs, abortion, depression, shock, and death. Animals that have recovered may become carriers, and serve as a source of infection for other animals and for humans. Advice to consumersHuman and pet food that is contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes may not look or smell spoiled but can still cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections. Anyone who has handled any of the recalled pet food and developed symptoms of Listeria infection should seek medical treatment and tell their doctors about the possible Listeria exposure. Also, anyone who has been exposed to any of the recalled product -- or lives in a household where the recalled pet food has been used -- should monitor themselves for symptoms during the coming weeks. It can take up to 70 days after exposure to Listeria for symptoms of listeriosis to develop.  Symptoms of Listeria infection in humans can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache and neck stiffness. Specific laboratory tests are required to diagnose Listeria infections, which can mimic other illnesses.  Pregnant women, the elderly, young children, and people such as cancer patients who have weakened immune systems are particularly at risk of serious illnesses, life-threatening infections and other complications. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, their infections can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth.

That was the case when some batches of commercially produced, packaged, whole caramel apples turned out to be the cause of a listeriosis outbreak in 2014-15 that infected 35 people from 12 states, putting 34 of them in the hospital. Listeria monocytogenes bacteria contributed to at least three of the seven deaths that were linked to the outbreak, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The onset of illnesses ranged from Oct. 2014 to Feb. 12, 2015, when CDC announced that the outbreak ""appears to be over."" When the outbreak began, no one suspected apples. After all, fresh apples had never been linked to any major food safety outbreaks. Quite the contrary.

But, no, to almost everyone's surprise, the source of the problem turned out to be fresh apples from Bidart Bros. in California.

In addition the inspectors ""observed direct food contact areas of packaging equipment used during the 2014 apple season, constructed and/or maintained in a manner that they cannot be properly cleaned."" Subsequent research revealed the Listeria monocytogenes on the apples' skins got pushed into their flesh when the sticks were inserted into them as part of the caramel apple production process. The caramel coating, in turn, sealed apple juice in between the skin and coating, providing a microenvironment where the Listeria could grow undisturbed. Not surprisingly, repercussions rained down on the apple industry. Washington state was hit especially hard. It is the nation's largest producer of apples, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, having produced 4,550 million pounds in 2010. In contrast, California produced only 115 million pounds that year. Of that comparatively small California volume, Bidart was not a major player. In other words, it was a relatively small orchard and packing house by industry standards. Yet with inaccurate news about the outbreak running rampant through social media, some importers in Asia temporarily stopped buying U.S. apples altogether. Before it was over, the outbreak had gouged  a $15 million hole in export sales for Washington state's apples. Mark Powers of theNorthwest Horticultural Council ""It was terrible -- totally out of control,"" Mark Powers of the Northwest Horticultural Council told more than 300 people attending the Center for Produce Safety's 7th annual food-safety research symposium. ""The response was off the charts -- out of the bounds of reality."" More than that, he said, it triggered ""a sea change in our thinking about export risks."" Bob Whitaker, chief science and technology officer for the Produce Marketing Association, described the situation as one of the industry's ""watershed moments,"" saying that ""everything is global now."" But thanks to some concerted diligence in getting the correct information out to the right people, the spilled apple cart was finally righted, and export sales resumed. But the fresh fruit industry had learned an important lesson. It was going to have to hunker down and take a ""whole-systems"" approach to food safety. And that meant packing lines were going to come under even closer scrutiny than before. Click on the image for a video of Cookson Beecher's interview with Ines Hanrahan. The times they are a changin' Something else had also changed. Before the outbreak, the main food safety focus for apple growers and shippers had been E. coli, since the outbreak, ""the focus is on Listeria almost entirely,"" Ines Hanrahan, project manager for the Washington Tree Fruit Research Commission, told symposium attendees. In response to the outbreak, the industry made quick progress in developing training and workshops on cleaning and sanitation in the packing sheds. Change was the name of the game. ""For the first time, the cleaning and sanitation personnel were included in the workshops,"" said Hanrahan, adding that suppliers were also included. ""We were getting everyone on the same page. We realized we had a lack of communication."" Instead of telling workers they needed to wear gloves and clean the brushes, for example, the workers were also told why doing that was important for food safety. They also learned why it's so important to properly clean equipment such as dunk tanks more frequently and why standing water is such a huge problem when it comes to food safety. Having a reward system in place, whether it be pizza parties or just the acknowledgment that the workers are doing things right, is also important, Hanrahan said. ""It's about the people,"" she said. ""About really understanding what they're accomplishing. And how does this relate to them -- to their family."" Changes in personnel can play a part in this since management and the crew leader need to have ""buy in"" for the need to take more time for cleaning. Those who don't, or won't, need to go. Having buy-in from ownership is also important. They need to know that ""If you don't get this straight, you won't have anything to sell,"" Hanrahan said.  When good needs to be better Not that the apple industry wasn't already following good food safety practices, especially since most of the retailers require food safety audits. In fact, many people at the research symposium agreed that the industry was ahead of the curve. But the Listeria outbreak put a tighter focus on what was needed to prevent foodborne pathogens from getting into packing sheds and onto the apples. The situation also saw industry competitors come together, with some opening their operations to one another as a way to share information. Coffee groups were formed, with competitors joining in. ""It expanded industry connections,"" said Hanrahan, sharing some of the key learnings from the outbreak:   Hanrahan also said when companies put in new packing lines, they need to make sure the drains are accessible for cleaning and that there's good lighting, adequate setups for cleaning, and enough water. Northwest Horticultural Council's Powers also offered some tips about the flow of information after an outbreak:   In many cases, said Powers, people didn't trust their own regulators. In other cases, social media is viewed as a trusted source of information. ""We didn't have the resources for social media,"" he said. As for some lessons learned about social media posts during outbreak and recall situations, Powers had this advice to share: ""Always put a date on your communications -- and get a social media expert."" ""We have to be trusted as a credible source of information,"" he said, referring to the need for the produce industry to work with researchers and media to get the right information out. He also pointed out that now, when anyone with a laptop can communicate whatever message he or she thinks is correct, there's a lot of room for a lot of miscommunication. During a break in the presentations, PMA's Whitaker stressed that social media is a tool that needs to be leveraged. ""It's one of these hurdles that we need to learn how to use,"" he said. ""You wouldn't have thought of it several years ago. But we can use it to get good food safety information out to people instead of just having it sit around on shelves in binders. The trick is to get it into the hands of the right people."" Kathleen Glass led the research team that documented how Listeria monocytogenes probably contaminated caramel apples in 2014. The research report is available in mBio, the journal of the American society for Microbiology. Looking ahead During her presentation about lessons learned during the outbreak, Kathleen Glass, associate director for the Food Research Institute at the University of Wisconsin, said data about the 2014-15 outbreak provides an explanation about why there was an outbreak and why something like it can potentially happen again. ""As we look at other types of food products, it highlights the effect of the microenvironment on food safety and emphasizes the need to be taking a look at other intervention strategies,"" she said. The ultimate goal, according to Glass: ""So we can make a listeria-free or pathogen-free environment for food products that might be able to support (pathogen) growth."" Martin Wiedmann, Gellert Family Professor of Food Safety at Cornell, also warned that fresh vegetable and fruit producers need to keep in mind what the end use of their product will be. In other words, ""What can go wrong with our product once it's out of our control. Could a use for the product turn it from a low-risk food into a high-risk food?"" ""In the end, this will come back to us,"" Wiedmann said, warning what could happen if looking forward isn't part of an overall food safety strategy. ""We need to think outside the box and envision new approaches,"" he said. (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

CFIA says the ongoing food safety investigation may soon result in the recall of other products. If other high-risk products are recalled, the CFIA will notify the public through updated food recall warnings. At the time the investigation was announced, there are 30 cases of Salmonella Enteritidis illness in four provinces: Alberta (2), Ontario (17), Quebec (7), and New Brunswick (4). Four individuals were hospitalized. Individuals became sick between May 2017 and February 2018. The average age of the infected is 32 years, with ages ranging from 1 to 73 years. The majority of illnesses (57 percent) involved males. Based on the investigation findings, exposure to poultry, including frozen raw breaded chicken products was identified as a source of illness. Several individuals who became ill reported consuming a mix of poultry and frozen raw breaded chicken products. Salmonella is commonly found in raw chicken and frozen raw breaded chicken products. Illnesses can be avoided if safe food handling, preparation and cooking practices are followed when preparing these types of food products. CFIA says the outbreak is a reminder to properly handle, cook and store poultry, including frozen breaded chicken products to avoid getting sick. Frozen raw breaded chicken products contain raw poultry and should be handled and prepared no differently from other raw poultry products. Canadians are advised to follow cooking instructions carefully and verify the internal temperature after cooking before consuming these products. Frozen raw breaded chicken products and raw poultry pieces must be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 74 degrees C -- 165 degrees F -- to ensure they are safe to eat. Whole poultry must be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 82 degrees C -- 180 degrees F -- to kill pathogens such as bacteria, viruses and parasites.

The restaurant was open as of last night. A dozen people have been so sick they have been admitted to hospitals; 14 have laboratory-confirmed Salmonella infections, a spokeswoman for the San Antonio Metro Health Division told local media on Friday. Health officials have not posted an update on the division's website since the original statement Sept. 6, when the patient count was ""more than 60."" ""(The division) is investigating a potential foodborne illness cluster following numerous, independent complaints of foodborne illness reported by individuals who have dined at Pasha's Mediterranean Grill on Wurzbach Road during the past Labor Day weekend,"" according to the Sept. 6 news release.  ""The restaurant is cooperating fully in the investigation and Metro Health staff is working with the restaurant to ensure all precautions are being taken to prevent any further illnesses."" Restaurant owner Kamran Vandi told the San Antonio News-Express he closed the implicated Pasha's location on Labor Day, Sept. 3, because a lightening strike Sept. 2 shorted out the restaurant's refrigerator. The restaurant reopened Sept. 4. Two days later Vandi told the News-Express the refrigerator ""wasn't on the right temperature, so we had to close (the restaurant) to be on the safe side,"" Vandi. It was some bad luck."" Health division spokeswoman Carol Schliesinger told San Antonio media the agency is investigating the restaurant. She said both dine-in and takeout services had been affected. City officials continue to urge recent Pasha's customers with any symptoms to speak with health officials. Customers can call Metro Health at 210-207-8876. Vandi told media outlets in San Antonio that Vandi two of his employees are being tested part of the investigation. The News-Express reported he said with all the traffic that goes through the restaurant, it's not surprising to him that an illness may have spread. Common symptoms of foodborne diseases, including infection by Salmonella bacteria, can include nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and diarrhea, according to public health officials. However, symptoms may differ among the different types of foodborne diseases. The Metro Health division is encouraging anyone who recently ate at the restaurant and developed symptoms of foodborne illness to seek medical attention. Recent inspections at Pasha'sThe restaurant earned more than a dozen violations in May when city inspectors checked the operation.  Those violations included problems with the employee hand-washing sink, a buildup of black material in the ice machine and on the walls, plumbing leaks, and improper storage of food. Also, inspectors reported no one on site was a certified food protection manager, which is required by law. Another violation was recorded in May because the person in charge could not provide food handler certificates for employees on duty. Food safety training is part of the certification process. The May inspection this year was not the first time health department staff found violations at the Pasha's location. In December 2017 public health inspectors noted violations, including one involving the hand-washing sink. In August 2017 inspectors noted another hand hygiene violation. They also found the Pasha's food license had expired. (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

There were 534 sick people as of late October with the majority falling ill since June. The first patient was in September 2020 and the peak was 80 cases reported in one week. Slightly more than half are male with an age range of 0 to 92 years old and a median of 54. A dozen were admitted to hospital but this information is only available for 35 people. The majority of those sick are in England but some patients live in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Whole genome sequencing identified the genetically similar Salmonella Infantis cases. It is thought to be the largest outbreak of this Salmonella type ever reported in Europe. Cases despite recallIn late August, the Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland advised consumers not to eat several pork scratching products purchased since February, which were linked to Salmonella poisoning. At that time, the agencies reported 179 people were sick. Tayto Group's recall included some Mr. Porky, Jay's and The Real Pork Crackling Company products. Production was halted at the implicated factory once a possible link was identified. Cases have reduced but continue to be reported despite the product recall. Items have best before dates up to and including Feb. 19, 2022. Microbiological investigations identified isolates matching the outbreak strain at the production site and in an unopened product from the day of inspection. Tayto Group, who also distributes to the EU and other countries, voluntarily suspended production and withdrew and recalled products as well as doing enhanced cleaning and microbiological testing. The original cause of contamination has not been determined with FSA traceback work including looking at pork rind supplied from three countries. Affected people seek answersEarlier this month, law firm Irwin Mitchell said it was working on behalf of eight people who believe they fell ill after eating Mr Porky products. These include a man from Malton, North Yorkshire, who was hospitalized and diagnosed with Salmonella Infantis after eating pork scratchings, and a retired elite swimmer from Merseyside. A woman is also still suffering from the effects of salmonellosis. Susan Williamson, from Blackhall Colliery, was taken to hospital and diagnosed with Salmonella Infantis infection. The 64-year-old had eaten pork scratchings. After undergoing further tests she was diagnosed with heart failure and wants to find out if this is linked to the Salmonella infection. Doctors told her she will need ongoing care and a procedure on her heart. Williamson said when she fell ill after eating the pork scratchings she thought it would only make her sick for a few days. ""Never did I ever imagine that it would lead to Salmonella and I would still be suffering more than two months on. I'm still very unwell now and have been told I'll need medical care for a long time. It's been such a traumatic time for me and my family,"" she said. ""It's also very worrying to think that there could be more people out there suffering like I am, and we deserve to have some answers as to how this happened.

Untreated sewage also was blamed for shellfish farm closures in Baynes Sound this year. But the Public Health Agency of Canada, working with provincial public health partners in investigating the Norovirus outbreak, noted that the precise cause of the contamination has not been identified. ""There are a number of potential risk factors, one of which is the herring fleet in Deep Bay,"" said Greg Thomas, executive director of the Herring Conservation and Research Society. ""In pre-season meetings with the herring industry advisors, DFO (Department of Fisheries and Oceans) reviewed the issue of contamination in Baynes Sound and prohibition on sewage discharge nearshore,"" Thomas told Victoria News. Dr. Paul Hasselback, medical health officer for Central Vancouver, told the newspaper the outbreak was caused by a single genotype that has not been seen in community-based illness in British Columbia since 2012. That led Hasselback to suggest the outbreak probably did not come from a land-based domestic source. ""It appears probably that the event was caused by a single contamination event likely around the time of the herring fishery,"" he said in a letter to the Regional District of Nanaimo. ""There is a strong suspicion that the event may be associated with untreated sewerage contamination associated with marine operations."" The herring run happened in March, when the presence of Vibrio Cholera were found in herring egg samples taken from the area of French Creek and Qualicum Bay after four people got sick after eating them. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans closed the area for harvesting of herring eggs. While investigations into the presence of Vibrio Cholera continue, Hasselback noted that it is most likely that that organism is naturally occurring in marine waters and unrelated to human sewage. In April, federal officials closed two shellfish farms due to the outbreak of Norovirus. Health authorities have reported about 40 cases of the acute gastrointestinal illness since early March. Dumping raw sewage by vessels is against the law and regulated by Transport Canada, but local officials say the agency is unable to fully enforce the law. Noroviruses cause acute gastroenteritis, sometimes thought to be stomach flu. This is not influenza or the flu, which is a respiratory infection caused by the influenza virus, Island Health said. Norovirus outbreaks occur in British Columbia each year and are common in long-term care homes, daycare centers, schools, hospitals and on cruise ships, the health agency said. The virus can be spread among people who do not wash their hands, or if someone with the illness handles food, water or ice. Norovirus can also be found in the vomit and diarrhea of people who are sick. Symptoms usually appear within 24 to 48 hours after exposure to the virus. There is no vaccine to prevent it and no treatment for the illness, but most people recover in two or three days. (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

The expansion of the recall is based on evidence provided by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) that all package sizes and brands of the products produced during the initial recall dates of Jan. 1, 2015, to Aug. 4 this year are misbranded as described in the initial recall. Some of the products contain pistachio nut and soy, known allergens, which are not declared on the product label. The basterma, sausage, soujouk, salami, mortadella, makanek, bologna, Lahmajun meat pie, and other sausage-like items were produced on various dates between Jan. 1, 2015, and Aug. 4 this year. The following products are subject to recall:   The recalled products are printed with ""EST. 19160"" inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations and wholesalers in California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. The problem was discovered during an ongoing FSIS investigation at the establishment following a complaint to the agency. The major public health concerns include listing hydrolyzed plant protein in the ingredient statement of the beef bologna and beef mortadella, but not specifying that soy, an allergen, is the source of that protein. Also, the beef mortadella products did not declare pistachio nut, an allergen, on individual package ingredient statements, although some cases of the product display a sticker stating ""Pistachio"" was in the product. FSIS also found that beef salami and beef bologna products contained poultry ingredients and a sausage product tested positive for Red Dye #40, which is not declared on product labels. Additionally, raw beef trim, designated for cooking only, was used in raw non-intact finished products. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

The illnesses have been linked to two brands of frozen berries: Nanna's Frozen Mixed Berries and Creative Gourmet Mixed Berries, both distributed by Patties Foods in the state of Victoria. The following products are subject to recall:   The 14 known illnesses are spread across in the following Australian states: New South Wales (5 illnesses), Queensland (5), Victoria (3) and Western Australia (1) Patties Foods is taking heat in the Australian media for sourcing berries from faraway countries such as China, Turkey and Chile, instead of domestically, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. The chief executive of Patties Foods told the Herald that raspberries are the common ingredient between the recalled packages and could likely be the source of the infections. Schools and childcare centers are reportedly on alert for Hepatitis A cases after serving the recalled berries to children, and many consumer advocates are urging Australian lawmakers to strengthen country-of-origin labeling laws. Healthcare centers around the country are reporting a spike in the number of people coming in with concerns about Hepatitis A infection. Frozen berries have been linked to numerous Hepatitis A outbreaks around the world in recent years. In 2013, frozen berry mixes from Townsend Farms sold at Costco stores sickened at least 162 people with Hepatitis A in the U.S. The contamination was ultimately traced back to pomegranate seeds in the mix that were sourced from Turkey. Also in 2013, frozen berry mixes sickened at least 1,444 Europeans with Hepatitis A. Hepatitis A is a communicable disease that spreads via the ""fecal-oral route."" Food-related outbreaks are usually associated with food contaminated during cultivation, harvesting, processing or distribution. Symptoms of Hepatitis A infection may include fatigue, diarrhea, stomach cramps, dark urine and jaundice. Approximately 10 to 12 days after exposure, symptoms may begin to appear, and Hepatitis A is present in an infected person's blood and is excreted into their feces. If someone is exposed to Hepatitis A but receives a vaccine within two weeks, they may significantly reduce their chances of experiencing symptoms. In general, symptoms of Hepatitis A infection usually last less than two months, although relapse is not unknown. Unlike chronic forms of Hepatitis, such as B and C, individuals with Hepatitis A infections typically recover. Once a person has recovered from a Hepatitis A infection, they are immune to the virus.

The CFS of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department received 229 reports of food poisoning outbreaks linked to businesses that affected 632 people. Under 200 outbreaks were reported in 2019 but more people fell ill than in 2020. The number of outbreaks linked to takeaway foods increased from 36, or 19.5 percent of the total, sickening 236 people in 2019 to 128, or 55.9 percent, affecting 331 people in 2020. This increase was mainly attributable to one incident traced to sandwiches. The agency noted that since the COVID-19 pandemic, takeaway foods have become more popular among the public. Bacterial foodborne agents remained the leading cause in 90 percent of outbreaks in 2020 with three quarters caused by Salmonella, followed by Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Bacillus cereus. Viruses accounted for 7 percent of all incidents with Norovirus mainly involved. Natural toxin cases such as mushroom toxins and ciguatera and chemical ones like calcium oxalate poisoning contributed to the remaining outbreaks. Large outbreak traced to sandwichesContamination by raw food or by food handlers and improper holding temperature were the three most frequently identified contributing factors. In May 2020, the CFS was told of an outbreak related to eating pre-packaged sandwiches of the same brand, involving 236 people. Stool samples of 42 affected people yielded Salmonella. One victim required intensive care and the blood specimen grew Salmonella Enteritidis. Group D Salmonella was also detected in an unconsumed sandwich bought by a victim. Sandwiches were produced by a local food factory. An investigation revealed a number of contributing factors to the outbreak, including ready-to-eat ingredients being contaminated by raw ingredients and food handlers, improper temperature during transport of the sandwiches to retail outlets, and improper storage temperature of finished products at the temperature danger zone allowing pathogens to grow. The manufacturer didn't provide the production and expiry date on the label of sandwiches for staff and customer information. A sandwich sample collected from an outlet tested positive for Group D Salmonella. CFS instructed the factory and retail outlets to stop the sale of all sandwiches and carry out thorough cleaning and disinfection. The factory operator has since ceased running the concerned food business. In September 2020, seven outbreaks involving 19 people were reported, involving takeaway lobster noodles bought from a restaurant. A victim's stool sample grew Vibrio parahaemolyticus. An investigation revealed the cooked lobsters were prepared too far in advance to cater for the high demand during busy hours, and might have been contaminated by food handlers and other raw seafood. The site was cleaned and disinfected and no further related incidents were received. Packaging positive for COVID-19 virusElsewhere, this past month a sample from the packaging of frozen crocodile spare ribs imported from Thailand to Hong Kong was found to be positive for the COVID-19 virus. CFS received a notification from the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health that among the environmental samples collected at the home of a confirmed coronavirus patient, a test from the product's packaging was positive for the virus. The agency said the sample was likely to have been contaminated at the residence of this person. CFS collected 103 samples from crocodile products, which included 41 food and 62 packaging swabs, from storage points, warehouses and retail outlets of the vendor concerned for testing. Results showed all samples were negative for the COVID-19 virus and the implicated company was allowed to resume product sales. CFS has stepped up precautionary measures, including enhanced testing of various types of frozen foods and their packaging imported from different countries and regions, which involves taking samples at cold stores of importers. The agency said it will continue surveillance on imported frozen foods and packaging to monitor the risk of the spread of the COVID-19 virus through such products. Up to the end of May, more than 10,000 food samples and packaging were collected to test for coronavirus. Results, including 40 crocodile products imported from Thailand, were all negative.

During June and July, the Texas Department of State Health Services saw a spike in the intestinal illness caused by consuming food or water contaminated with Cyclospora parasites, upping the year-to-date number of cases to 68. There were 148 cases of cyclosporiasis illness in 2016. The 2016 case count was an improvement on the previous three years. Texas reported 351 cyclosporiasis in 2013; 200 in 2014; and 316 in 2015. In response to the recent uptick, the Texas Department of State Health Services is asking healthcare providers to test for the Cyclospora parasite if any patient reports having diarrheal illness lasting more than a few days or diarrhea accompanied by severe anorexia or fatigue. A cyclosporiasis diagnosis requires three stool samples for ""Ova and Parasite"" testing. ""Rapid reporting to public health, enabling prompt investigation to identify possible common exposures, is essential to preventing additional cases of cyclosporiasis,"" according to the department. ""Usually, cyclosporiasis symptoms begin in 2 to 14 days after ingestion of the Cyclospora oocysts in contaminated food and water. Profuse diarrhea can last for weeks to months, and may relapse. Anorexia, fatigue, weight loss, abdominal cramps, bloating, increased gas, nausea, vomiting and low-grade fever are among the additional symptoms."" Texas has yet to determine a common exposure source for this year's increased cases. However, a statement from Health Services said past outbreaks have been associated with consumption of imported fresh produce, including fresh cilantro, pre-packaged salad mixes, raspberries, basil, snow peas and mesclun lettuce. The state recommends washing fresh produce, but warns that Cyclospora can be difficult to remove. Cooking kills the parasite. The parasite infection is not generally transmitted from person-to-person. In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said reductions in cyclosporiasis illnesses in Texas and as many as two dozen other states was because Mexican cilantro imports to the United States were getting more careful scrutiny. FDA has been focused on fresh cilantro from the Puebla region of Mexico for at least the past four years. In 2013-2015, FDA found farms and packing houses in the Puebla region with ""objectionable conditions"" that could contaminate produce with ""human fecal pathogens."" After that, imported cilantro from the region was subject to an Import Alert and ""detained"" at U.S. borders without physical inspection. FDA then came up with a so-called ""Green List"" of 10 Puebla region growers who agreed to good production practices in order to get their imports cleared.

One has been declared over and the other is ongoing. The ongoing outbreak linked to Citterio brand ""Premium Italian-Style Salame Sticks"" sold by Trader Joe's and other grocers has had an additional person added to the patient list, bringing the total to 21. The sick people are spread across eight states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Patients in the outbreak are infected with Salmonella I 4,[5],12:i:- and have had illness onset dates ranging from Sept. 18 through Oct. 3. Sick people range in age from 2 to 75 years old, with a median age of 12. Most of the sick people, 81 percent are younger than 18 years old, and 62 percent are female. Of 18 people with information available, six have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for Salmonella. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it can take more than a month to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.  State and local public health officials are interviewing people about the foods they ate in the week before they got sick. Among 15 people interviewed, all reported eating salami sticks, and 14 reported eating or maybe eating Citterio brand Premium Italian-Style ""Salame"" Sticks. Thirteen people bought Citterio brand Premium Italian-Style ""Salame"" Sticks from Trader Joe's, and one person bought them from a Wegman's grocery store. Whole genome sequencing analysis of bacteria from 14 people's samples and one raw ground pork sample predicted resistance to one or more of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, kanamycin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline.  The CDC is continuing to advise people not to eat, sell, or serve Citterio brand Premium Italian-Style ""Salame"" Sticks regardless of where they were purchased. Antipasto products Salmonella outbreak overThe CDC has declared that the Salmonella outbreak associated with Fratelli Beretta uncured antipasto products has ended. Two outbreak strains were identified, Salmonella Infantis sickened 14 people and Salmonella Typhimurium infected 26 people. The outbreak patients live in 17 states. Illnesses started on dates ranging from May 9 to Aug. 16. Sick people ranged in age from 1 to 91 years old, with a median age of 41, and 51 percent were male. Of 35 people with information available, 12 were hospitalized. No deaths were reported. State and local public health officials interviewed people about the foods they ate in the week before they got sick. Of the 28 people interviewed, 26 reported eating a variety of Italian-style meats. Among 15 people who remembered the specific product or had shopper card records showing a purchase, 14 had Fratelli Beretta brand prepackaged Uncured Antipasto trays. Public health investigators used the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that were part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using whole genome sequencing (WGS). For each outbreak strain, WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This suggests that people in each outbreak got sick from eating the same food. Antibiotic resistance testing for the antipasto outbreak using whole genome sequencing showed 96 percent of people tested had infections that were resistant to ampicillin. The testing of all samples showed resistance to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline for all samples.  However, if antibiotics are needed, illnesses in this outbreak may be difficult to treat with ampicillin and may require a different antibiotic choice. Testing for the Salmonella Infantis infections did not predict any antibiotic resistance. (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

State officials linked the dairy to an outbreak of E. Coli infections beginning in May. As of June 24 there were 17 confirmed patients in the outbreak. Ten of the patients are younger than 10 years old. Ten of the 17 patients have had such severe symptoms they had to be admitted to hospitals. The Washington health department has not released the ages of those who have hospitalized. Of the 17 outbreak patients, four have developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a type of kidney failure that can be fatal. Three of the patients live in Arizona and are thought to have become infected through person-to-person contact by visitors from Washington. Most of the sick people reported eating organic yogurt made by the Pure Eire Dairy in Othello, WA. Both PCC brand and Pure Eire brand yogurt have been recalled. In a Facebook statement the owners of the dairy thanked supporters and said they would be selling their cows. Following is their statement in its entirety.  ""As you are probably aware, our family has decided to move on to a new 'era' and have closed our dairy.  ""We feel so fortunate to have gotten to live our little dream and run a successful business based on our personal beliefs. A true testament to our practices came up as we were sorting cows this past week. We are proud to say we have a large handful of beautiful cows that are 18 years old and have been on this entire journey with us. They'll stay with us and enjoy a retirement full of lush pastures. Our special practices gave us the opportunity to love on these special girls for so many years.  ""We were not shut down by any of the state agencies, nor did we ever find an issue on the dairy. We decided it was time to focus on our family life. Many of you met our children as toddlers and now they are working on high school and college!  It's amazing how time flies! ""We couldn't be more thankful for the support we've received over the years. You all are the reason we could dairy the way we did.

""I'll try to continue to post information (such as cows we have available) as we work through this transition. Again, we are so grateful for your support over the years and as our family moves on to new ventures. You never know what the future will bring!"" The state continues its investigation. A civil lawsuit filed by the parents of two children, aged 3 and 1 years old, says both children required hospitalization and one developed HUS. Both children ate some of the implicated yogurt before becoming ill with the outbreak strain of E. coli, according to the legal complaint. The children's recoveries are ongoing and their futures are uncertain, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of Washington says the PCC brand yogurt from Pure Eire Dairy was contaminated with E. coli when it left the dairy. The complaint alleges that the dairy owners were negligent when they offered the implicated yogurt for sale. ""The minor plaintiffs are in the class of persons intended to be protected by these statutes and regulations, and the minor plaintiffs were injured as the direct and proximate result of the defendant's violation of applicable federal, state, and local food safety regulations,"" according to the legal complaint. Another civil lawsuit, also in the Superior Court of Washington, has been filed by the parents of a minor child. She ate the implicated yogurt before becoming ill. The child was admitted to a hospital and developed HUS. Her recovery is ongoing with her future uncertain. The second lawsuit also alleges that the dairy owners were negligent. ""The defendant had a duty to manufacture and sell food products that were from reliable sources and that were clean, wholesome, free from adulteration and fit for human consumption, but failed to do so, and therefore breached that duty,"" according to the lawsuit. "". . . The minor plaintiff's injuries proximately and directly resulted from the defendant's breach of express and implied warranties, and the plaintiffs are thus entitled to recover for all actual, consequential, and incidental damages that flow directly and in a foreseeable fashion from these breaches.""

The recalled turkey was shipped to retail locations nationwide. Based on the continuing investigation, additional products from other companies may also be recalled. As recently as Nov. 15, the Jennie-O Turkey Store in  Barron, WI, began a recall that ended up totaling more than 147,000 pounds of raw ground turkey products that also may be associated with an outbreak of Salmonella Reading infections. As the latest Jennie-O raw turkey recall was being announced, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was also providing an update on the Salmonella Reading outbreak. The CDC says since its Nov. 8 report, 52 people from 26 states and the District of Columbia have been added to the outbreak totals. The agency also reported the first fatality in the outbreak. FSIS is concerned that some of the recalled turkey may be frozen and in consumers' homes. Anyone who has purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. To view photos from all of the products subject to the new recall, please click here.

FSIS, CDC,  the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, and the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, have been conducting traceback activities for a sample of Jennie-O brand ground turkey in an intact, unopened package from a case-patient's home. The patient tested positive for Salmonella Reading and the samples from the case-patient and from the ground turkey are closely related genetically. This investigation is part of a larger effort involving FSIS, the CDC, and state public health and agriculture partners. Patients have reported eating different types and brands of turkey products purchased from many different stores, handling raw turkey pet food and/or raw turkey, or working with live turkeys or living with someone who handled live turkeys. FSIS continues to work with the CDC and state health and agriculture departments on this larger investigation and will provide updated information as it becomes available. Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume raw poultry product that has been cooked to a temperature of 165degF. Safe steps in food handling, cooking, and storage are essential in preventing foodborne illness. You can't see, smell, or taste harmful bacteria that may cause illness.

The agency reported the Sofina Foods Inc. distributed the recalled products to retailers nationwide. The Public Health Agency of Canada continues to warn the public about the dangers of raw frozen breaded chicken products. The agency reported that as of March 1, there had been a total of 555 laboratory-confirmed outbreak victims nationwide. Of those for whom complete information is available, 92 people had to be admitted to hospitals.  Three of the confirmed patients have died. However, the government reported two of them died because of other conditions present during their salmonellosis. The third patient's specific cause of death remained under investigation as of the March 1 update. As of March 1, the federal public health agency was involved in two active national Salmonella outbreak investigations linked to raw chicken including frozen raw breaded chicken products. ""When not thoroughly cooked, frozen breaded chicken products containing raw chicken pose an increased health risk to individuals who handle, prepare or consume them. These products may appear to be pre-cooked or browned, but they should be handled and prepared with caution,"" according to the public health warning that has been in place for almost two years. The March 21 recall marks the fifth time since 2017 that Sofina Foods Inc. has had to recall Janes brand frozen breaded chicken products. Combined, Sofina, Loblaws, and other companies have recalled dozens of such products since July 2017.

""While breaded chicken nuggets, chicken burgers and strips may look like they're pre-cooked, many frozen breaded poultry products are actually raw and need to be handled carefully and cooked thoroughly,"" Health Canada stated in a public health warning. Raw meat and poultry can contain harmful bacteria such as Salmonella, E. coli, and Listeria. However, Salmonella and other harmful foodborne bacteria can be completely eliminated by cooking thoroughly. Health Canada provided this advice for consumers preparing frozen, raw, breaded poultry products:   Symptoms of a Salmonella infection, called salmonellosis, typically start 6 to 72 hours after exposure to Salmonella bacteria from an infected animal or contaminated product. Symptoms include fever, chills, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, headache, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms usually last four to seven days. In healthy people, salmonellosis often clears up without treatment. In some cases, severe illness and hospitalization may occur. People who are infected with Salmonella bacteria can be infectious from several days to several weeks. People who experience symptoms, or who have underlying medical conditions, should contact their health care providers if they suspect they have a Salmonella infection.

One death in Florida is associated with the outbreak. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), and state health officials are investigating the multistate outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes infections linked to deli meats. It is the second multistate outbreak of Listeria to be reported during 2020.  According to the CDC: Anyone who is pregnant, aged 65 years or older, or has a weakened immune system.  is at higher risk for getting sick with Listeria. If you are not in these groups, you are unlikely to get sick from Listeria. Deli meats, also called lunch meat or cold cuts, can have Listeria bacteria. Avoid eating deli meats, unless heated to an internal temperature of 165degF or until steaming hot just before serving. Take additional steps to prevent getting sick: Call your healthcare provider if you ate deli meats and are experiencing symptoms of Listeria infection.

Zucchinis, also called courgettes, contain a naturally occurring compound. When this is at a high enough level it can lead to symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea. Four families in Castle Acre, Norfolk, reported feeling unwell after eating produce they had grown, according to the BBC. The Sun newspaper reported a woman needed hospital treatment after being poisoned by courgettes she had grown. They came from Unwins seeds and parent company Westland told The Sun that it had temporarily suspended shipments as a precaution while it investigated the issue. Product recallAnother firm, Mr Fothergill's, recalled a batch of Courgette Zucchini that could contain seeds that produce bitter tasting fruits. The affected item has Batch code I on the back of the packet. A statement from Mr Fothergill's said such a problem is extremely rare, but not unknown. It advised people not to eat the zucchini and discard the plants. ""It can come from issues with cross-pollination in the seed production cycle and is untraceable before growing out again for harvest. Please be assured that we take every precaution to maintain the quality of our seed stock. In this instance we have withdrawn the rogue batch from all sales outlets and in-house stocks,"" said the company. ""We recommend that if you have grown this variety from a packet with the batch code I that you do not ingest the fruits without taste testing for bitterness. A taste-test is a safe thing to do to detect if you have an affected plant which will be extremely bitter slice the top off the fruit and simply touch your tongue on it."" All remaining stock in the warehouse, unpacked seeds and seeds in retail outlets are being recovered and destroyed. Possible cause of problemThe bitter taste of some fruit is caused by an over-production of plant defense chemicals called cucurbitacins. This is mainly a problem in courgettes and summer squash and is caused primarily by a mutation within the plant. The problem is more likely when plants are grown from saved seeds, where inadvertent cross-pollination may have occurred, according to the Royal Horticultural Society. High temperatures, dryness and other stresses when growing can also lead to an increase in cucurbitacins. Mr Fothergill's has tracked the issue to one batch of seed which came from a grower with ""meticulous"" growing and husbandry routines. ""Normally cucurbitacins exist in very small amounts but genetic issues in the production cycle very occasionally deliver larger amounts into the seed which cause the bitter flavor. It's impossible to test for in the seed itself and we have never had a batch of seed like this in our 40 plus year history."" (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

No illnesses had been reported to in relation to the recalled product as of the posting of the recall. The company reports the product was distributed in the province of Quebec.  About Listeria infectionsFood contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes may not look or smell spoiled but can still cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections. Anyone who has eaten any recalledproduct and developed symptoms of Listeria infection should seek medical treatment and tell their doctors about the possible Listeria exposure. Also, anyone who has eaten any of the recalled product should monitor themselves for symptoms during the coming weeks because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to Listeria for symptoms of listeriosis to develop. Symptoms of Listeria infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache, and neck stiffness. Specific laboratory tests are required to diagnose Listeria infections, which can mimic other illnesses. Pregnant women, the elderly, young children, and people such as cancer patients who have weakened immune systems are particularly at risk of serious illnesses, life-threatening infections, and other complications. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, their infections can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or even stillbirth.

At least 13 people fell ill after eating Minh Chay brand pate, which was recalled earlier this year. A study published by Wellcome Open Research covers six patients who contracted botulism after eating the commercially made pate. Clinical diagnosis was confirmed by identification of Clostridium botulinum type B from the suspected food source made by Loi Song Moi Company. Botulinum antitoxin was not available in Vietnam during the outbreak in July and August. It was provided by the World Health Organization at the beginning of September. Initial and ongoing treatmentIn July 2020, a Taiwanese 36-year-old man went to the Department of Tropical Diseases, Cho Ray hospital in Ho Chi Minh City. He had been referred from his local hospital in Khanh Hoa province, where he had been admitted four days previously with a one-day history of nausea and vomiting. He reported consumption of seafood one day prior to onset of original symptoms. Because of this, the initial diagnosis was saxitoxin, brevetoxin or tetrodotoxin poisoning. The second case was his wife. She was a Vietnamese 36 year old in the second trimester of pregnancy and accompanied her husband to hospital. She had the same seafood as him, and similar gastrointestinal symptoms one day later. She had not previously been assessed but mentioned blurred vision and swallowing difficulties. Three days following hospital admission their conditions had deteriorated with worsening respiratory function. Foodborne botulism was suspected and dietary history re-explored from their relatives. This revealed the couple had eaten the same brand of vegetarian mushroom pate produced in Vietnam 20 to 36 hours before the first symptoms occurred. The next three patients were Vietnamese women aged 20, 24 and 26, also referred from local hospitals at the end of July. The trio were friends with no social link to the first two patients. They had a history of gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, followed by development in the next two days of neurological issues, difficulty breathing and limb weakness. Because of the similarity to cases one and two, a history of food consumption was taken. They had eaten the same brand of vegetarian pate as the previous couple between 24 and 48 hours before onset of symptoms. Samples of remaining pate from patients' houses were taken. Presence of Clostridium botulinum in the food samples of all cases was confirmed and diagnosis of botulism  established. Clostridium botulinum was not isolated from these patients but it was detected in the stool of two other cases. Stock of antitoxin for rare diseasesThe vegetarian pate contained almond, walnuts and cashews, as well as mushroom, and came in metal containers which provided the anaerobic conditions needed for bacterium growth and toxin production. The last case was a 54-year-old Vietnamese man who went to the department in August, three weeks after the first five cases. He gave a history of dizziness, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain which occurred 24 hours after eating the same brand of vegetarian pate. Over the next 24 hours, he developed other symptoms including double and blurred vision. All six cases required intubation and mechanical ventilation. The time to this following consumption of the pate ranged from four to nine days. Given that botulinum antitoxin was not accessible, and their severe status, all patients received a trial of plasma exchange therapy, but no clear benefit was seen. Delay in diagnosis and lack of specific treatment are likely to result in worse clinical outcomes. ""The logistics of maintaining stocks of costly antitoxin for what are rare diseases is a challenge; cross-border cooperatives with rapid dissemination of stocks as needed may be one solution,"" said researchers. The first five cases stayed in hospital for four to five weeks before referral to their local hospitals for ICU care. All patients required ongoing invasive mechanical ventilation when discharged. The sixth patient remained in intensive care in Cho Ray hospital as of late October. (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Public Health England (PHE) are investigating the incident with 99 people sick since April. It was previously known that 52 people were ill in the UK. Those more than 70 and less than 9 years old are the age groups mostly affected. Investigations are focusing on the supply chain of galia, cantaloupe and honeydew melons from Honduras and Costa Rica. FSA is working with trade associations and retail businesses to get information relevant to the outbreak. A quick rise in confirmed infections occurred in the week commencing May 24. Initial advice from the FSA warned about consuming whole melons from Brazil but further investigations including analysis of the food chain and testing has shown that product from Brazil is unlikely to be involved. Most UK retailers may have stocked the affected melons, which have now been removed from sale. Affected fruit was bought on or before May 28. People can identify the country of origin from a sticker on the fruit. If the fruit does not have a sticker consumers who have it in their homes should throw it away in an abundance of caution.

In a report dated today, eight months after the outbreak, scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and several states provide details on the Salmonella Oslo outbreak. At least 14 people were sickened, with three requiring hospitalization. Their illness onset dates ranged from March 21 to April 9. The Food and Drug Administration was aware of the outbreak at the time and helped with the investigation, but neither CDC not the FDA went public with any information until this week. Of the 14 sick people, who ranged in age from 3 to 68 years old, officials interviewed 13. A dozen of them reported eating cucumbers in the week before becoming sick. ""Among the 12 patients who consumed cucumbers, 11 specifically reported Persian or 'mini' cucumbers, which are small, seedless cucumbers with smooth skin. Eight of 13 respondents reported purchasing their cucumbers from chain A,"" according to the CDC's outbreak analysis in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Federal and state officials believe the implicated cucumbers were sold in the U.S. by at least two nationwide grocery chains, which have only been identified as ""chain A and chain B."" No recall was initiated at the time of the outbreak and no public notice was provided. ""With regard to this outbreak, the FDA wasn't able to find the source,"" said an FDA spokesman who fielded questions Thursday. ""We narrowed it down to three possible countries of origin, but we were unable to fully traceback the pathogen. FDA also wasn't able to confirm cucumbers as the vehicle. There were no positive samples."" The three possible countries or origin, according to the CDC's report, were Canada, Mexico and the Dominican Republic. ""The investigation identified two Canadian (mini) cucumber suppliers during the timeframe of interest, but a single grower was not identified. Growers who could have supplied these cucumbers were located in Canada, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic,"" according to the CDC's report. ""These Canadian-grown cucumbers would have also been distributed in Canada and no reported clinical cases matching the U.S. outbreak pattern were identified."" Traceback revealed that the cucumbers victims purchased at both ""chain A"" and ""chain B"" were sourced from a common produce supplier. ""Chain A voluntarily removed all Persian cucumber products from their shelves while the investigation and traceback efforts were ongoing,"" the CDC reports. The trouble with cucumbers is, ... to be determinedThis spring's outbreak marks the fourth time since 2013 that fresh cucumbers have been implicated in a Salmonella outbreak in the United States. More than 1,200 people total were sickened by the outbreaks in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Two of the outbreaks involved cucumbers from Mexico and the other was traced to cucumbers from the Delmarva region (Delaware, Maryland and Virginia). Those outbreaks were red flags for FDA, which launched a special testing program on cucumbers in an effort to find out more about foodborne pathogen risks from the vegetable that is most often consumed raw. ""Because the prevalence of Salmonella in cucumbers is unknown, FDA has initiated an enhanced sampling program for both domestic and imported whole, fresh, raw cucumbers within fiscal year 2016,"" the CDC scientists noted in their report on this past spring's outbreak. ""The data  -- approximately 380 domestic cucumber samples and more than 1,200 imported cucumber samples -- will suggest whether any common factors, such as season, region, and whether the product was produced domestically or imported, are associated with Salmonella contamination."" Despite the lack of a smoking gun and the ongoing testing project, federal officials said in the CDC report that the discovery and investigation of the outbreak this past spring shows that high-tech tools are paying off. Scientists turn into SherlocksState and local public health officials in Minnesota and Michigan were the first to begin looking into the Salmonella Oslo outbreak this past spring when they identified four people with unusual infections. Then the CDC's PulseNet, a national molecular sub-typing network for foodborne disease surveillance, confirmed a multi-state cluster of illnesses from a previously unknown strain. ""This PFGE pattern (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern) was new in the database; no previous infections or outbreaks have been identified,"" CDC reports. The disease detectives used a combination of high-tech whole genome sequencing and old-fashioned Q&amp;A for the next phase of the investigation. ""Initial interviews of ill persons found that shopping at a national chain grocer -- chain A -- and purchasing produce was commonly reported. A structured, focused supplemental questionnaire was developed to collect detailed information on exposure to grocery stores and produce, including cucumbers and leafy greens, in the seven days before illness onset,"" according to the CDC report. ""Cucumber samples were collected from the point of sale, from patients' homes, and from one of the Canadian suppliers, approximately one month after the patients' purchase date, but no cucumbers yielded Salmonella. ""... This report highlights some of the inherent difficulties associated with outbreak investigations in which relatively short shelf life produce items are suspected. Given that the typical shelf life of cucumbers is 10-14 days, suspected cucumbers were no longer available in homes at the time ill persons were interviewed."" Cooperation, coordination crucialAlthough science and technology are making it easier to detect and trace outbreaks, the CDC report on this year's Salmonella Oslo outbreak shows more research is needed, according to the scientists behind it. ""Further research is needed to understand the mechanism and factors that contribute to contamination of cucumbers during growth, harvesting, and processing to prevent future outbreaks,"" the CDC investigators wrote. They are particularly interested in finding out more about how cucumbers are contaminated with Salmonella because the bacteria is the most common cause of foodborne disease in the United States. It annually causes the more hospitalizations and deaths than other foodborne pathogens. ""Recent outbreaks have used industry consultations to help provide clues to focus the investigation, so information about cucumber harvesting and distribution was readily available,"" according to the CDC report. ""Early identification and prompt investigation of this outbreak while it was still occurring was important because it enabled investigators to present evidence to chain A, a national grocer. Chain A's swift action to remove all Persian cucumber products, in addition to the short shelf life of cucumbers, likely contributed to the small size and short duration of this outbreak. ""Quick action by industry is essential to control future outbreaks.

Preparing the dining room with the good china.  Diffusing political conversations at the dinner table. Some traditions give a sense of warmth, connection, and continuity, and regularly define a family's holiday.    Unfortunately, there is now a need to add an additional tradition to the season - actively checking for foodborne outbreaks and recalls to prevent folks from getting sick.   Last week, on Tuesday, Nov.20 at 2p.m., two days before Thanksgiving, the CDC posted a media statement with advice to consumers, restaurants, and retailers:   ""CDC is advising that U.S. consumers not eat any romaine lettuce, and retailers and restaurants not serve or sell any, until we learn more about the outbreak."" The need to release such a notice, right before a major holiday is an unpropitious scenario. It was also very concerning in its specificity to consumers, retailers and restaurants: ""Wash and sanitize drawers or shelves in refrigerators where romaine was stored."" Such an alert is most effective if it reaches the intended audiences. Folks at my holiday table did not hear about the outbreak.  Neither did many local health departments.  Do they hear what you sayIssuing media releases is one way for public health agencies to reach large groups of people.   However, distracted by holiday preparations, travel, shopping, family, football and bad weather this advisory was only partially disseminated to the public. A person had to be following news outlets or social media to receive timely notice. I heard about the recall from the woman next to me while I was getting a haircut - not from the CDC or FDA, or any other federal or state agency.     It's disturbing. The CDC could have sent this info directly to local health departments, or notify them that a news release was issued. This was not the first time as a local public health official that I received delayed - or no - official communication about a national foodborne issue.  Local public health professionals rely on communications systems established by federal and state oversight agencies. Most commonly, if a verified or suspect foodborne contamination or outbreak has occurred, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or the Food and Drug Administration will ascertain the appropriateness of information release. If this information is deemed credible, notification is forwarded individually or en masse to state departments of health. The states, in turn, push this information down to local regulators. Each step in the process contains elements that may delay the rapid dissemination of outbreak information. The ability and willingness of all stakeholders to quickly and readily share incident particulars with fellow responding agencies can enhance effectiveness and amplify response efforts. Electronically sending this advisory directly to the nearly 3,000 local health departments in the U.S. would provide the opportunity for hundreds of health inspectors, health educators, epidemiologists and others to reach the hospitals, food banks, schools, mom and pop establishments and local residents who may not have otherwise received the alert. This was a missed opportunity, and hopefully one that didn't cause additional cases of illness.  As I've written before, coordinated communication strategies within and between public health agencies is less robust than it should be. As a result, state and local public health officials may hear about foodborne disease issues first from other sources, such as the media, word of mouth, public complaints, or the food industry.     We need to learn how to communicate better with each other. Local public health shouldn't have to keep an eye on the news media, Twitter or Facebook for information pertinent to protecting the people in our jurisdictions. A multitude of electronic portals exist for purposes of interagency communication. CDC, FDA, USDA and the public health system should collectively define how pertinent information - such as this romaine advisory - rapidly and routinely gets to the grass roots public health workforce. Continuously improving interagency coordination and communication is a goal that is fundamental to increasing the effectiveness of this nation's food safety systems.

""We encourage the local authorities to interview the patients as soon and thoroughly as possible by using an online questionnaire that is readable at THL in real-time. We compare the interviews in order to find common exposures. ""We also encourage the local authorities to go through foods in patients' homes and test risky foods for Listeria. The Finnish Food Authority (Ruokavirasto) types Listeria strains from foods that have been tested in April and May in order to find similar strains as in patients. We also check if we can use patients' purchase information to find common exposures."" Below 100 infections per yearThe Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) 6 cluster is being investigated with the help of whole genome sequencing. The THL is not aware of similar cases in other countries. Finland has between 40 and 90 listeriosis cases annually. Listeriosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. Symptoms include fever, muscle pain, septicemia (blood poisoning) and meningitis. The incubation period is usually one to two weeks but can vary between a few and 70 days. The elderly, pregnant women, newborn infants and people with weak immune systems are more susceptible to infections. High risk foods include pre-packed sandwiches, deli and ready-to-eat meat products such as cooked, cured and/or fermented meats and sausages, soft cheeses and cold smoked fishery products. Between March and May, four suspected foodborne outbreaks were reported in the country, compared with an average of 18 in previous years, according to the THL. The agency believes this is because of the coronavirus pandemic and associated limitations and recommendations. When hands are washed and food prepared for smaller groups, there are fewer epidemics.

We are in the unique position to know many, but not all, of the ""points of sale"" - restaurants and grocery stores - involved in the E. coli O157:H7 outbreak linked to romaine lettuce. Having over 100 clients allows us to dig deep into their purchase history and consumption history. We have already determined clusters of illnesses linked to Panera, Texas Roadhouse, Red Lobsters and Papa Murphy's. We also have identified a processor - Freshway Foods. We have reached out to several other retailers, suppliers, processors and growers to ask (first nicely and then with a subpoena) if they will cooperate or not. We will continue our efforts and share what we find with the FDA and the public. I will not complain here - again - about why the FDA refuses to name those involved - from farms, distributors, processors and  retailers (stores and restaurants).

Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (e.g., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.

Four cases are children. Of four patients hospitalized, two have been discharged. All six patients are stable and recovering or fully recovered, said Marin County Public Health Officer Dr. Matt Willis. ""We're encouraged that we haven't seen any new cases reported in the last 24 hours,"" Willis told the Marin Independent Journal. ""This is looking like a small outbreak."" Inspections of places were the patients bought or ate food have not revealed any contaminated products or evidence for ongoing risk to the public. A regional and state labs are collaborating to perform DNA fingerprinting on the bacteria to help determine if people were infected with the same strain. Health officials said the individuals developed symptoms between Sept. 11 and Sept. 15 and that the victims are residents of Tiburon, San Anselmo, Inverness and San Rafael. Marin averages about five cases of E coli O157 each year. Infection-causing E. coli, commonly associated with undercooked hamburger, can be acquired from numerous raw foods and dairy products, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most people recover from the infection within a week, but some victims can die from E. coli if they develop a form of kidney failure known as ""hemolytic uremic syndrome,"" or HUS. To limit the potential of getting an E. coli infection, practice good food hygiene practices such as washing hands with soap and water after changing diapers and using the bathroom and before preparing or eating food. Cook meats thoroughly and wash counters, cutting boards and utensils after they touch raw meat to avoid cross-contamination. Symptoms of E. coli infection include severe stomach cramps, diarrhea, bloody diarrhea and vomiting. Anyone experiencing these symptoms is encouraged to visit their doctor.

The sick people had traveled to several other countries, including the Dominican Republic, Indonesia and Mexico. Infection is usually acquired from food or water contaminated by human feces. Microscopic amounts of feces are enough to contaminate large amounts of food and beverages. Previous outbreaks have been traced to soft fruits like raspberries and fresh produce including cilantro, coriander, basil and lettuce. Between 2005 and 2014, an average of 32 people fell ill with Cyclospora parasite infections in England and Wales each year. Reports of Cyclospora infections in United Kingdom travelers are being monitored by Public Health England, Health Protection Scotland, Public Health Wales and the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland. Since 2015 there have been seasonal outbreaks of Cyclospora infection in UK travelers returning from Mexico. Annual case counts are: Most patients stayed in the Riviera Maya and Cancun regions of Mexico. The source of infection was likely contaminated food supplied to hotels throughout the area, according to public health officials. Belgium reported four cases of cyclosporiasis in 2017, three of whom had a travel history to Mexico and France had six confirmed and three probable infections in July and August 2016 in citizens returning from Mexico. Symptoms of Cyclospora infection can include diarrhea, fever, fatigue and muscle pain, appetite loss, weight loss, cramping, gas, bloating and nausea. If it isn't treated, the illness may last from a few days to a month or longer. Symptoms typically begin seven days after ingestion of the Cyclospora oocysts, which are the infective form of the parasite. As of May 29, 2019, two laboratory-confirmed cases of cyclosporiasis had been reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by South Carolina and Connecticut. The two people became ill between May 1 and 29. They had no history of international travel during the 14-day period before illness onset. In 2018, almost 2,300 lab-confirmed patients were reported to the CDC by 33 states. The people became ill from May through August. None had a history of international travel. Cyclospora parasites, which cannot be seen by the human eye, have been documented repeatedly by U.S. outbreak investigators in cilantro from Mexico.

In September 2017, a cluster of monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium isolates was identified at the National Reference Laboratory for Enteropathogenic Bacteria in Norway. The dispersion of cases around Norway initially suggested an outbreak linked to a nationally distributed product, according to the study published in the journal Eurosurveillance. Incubation periods ranged from zero to 16 days and increased as the outbreak progressed, likely due to increasingly low-dose exposure as control measures were implemented. The incubation period of salmonellosis is typically between six and 72 hours. Researchers recommended strengthened hygiene in the case of established environmental contamination as control measures, including temporary closure and kitchen refurbishment, failed to eliminate the environmental source. Joe &amp; The Juice cafeThe 21 people had consumed food or drinks from the Joe &amp; The Juice cafe at Oslo Airport, which was outside the security restricted area in the terminal and accessible to anyone visiting the airport. The source of infection was either introduced via a contaminated food item or infected staff. The cafe, where large quantities of fresh ingredients are processed, is part of an international chain with the company operating sites in seven European countries and nations outside Europe. Thirteen of those ill were women and ages ranged from 17 to 60 years old. Those sick lived in 10 geographically dispersed counties in Norway. International requests revealed no infections in other European countries. Date of symptom onset was available for 16 cases and ranged from Aug. 23 to Nov. 18, 2017, with most in the first week of the outbreak. For the 15 cases with available date of symptom onset and of exposure, the incubation period ranged between zero and 16 days and increased as the outbreak progressed. The median incubation period in August was 4.5 days (range zero to five) and nine days (range two to 16) from September onwards. Dates of onset for the first cases between Aug. 22 and 28 suggested the outbreak was caused by a source introduced at the cafe in mid-August. During the next several weeks it was open, which meant ongoing exposure for customers and staff. Duration of the outbreak from August until November and the increasing incubation period over this time suggested the source was environmental as customers were continuously exposed but the dose of Salmonella decreased. In mid-September 2017, the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) for Enteropathogenic Bacteria for human matrices at the Norwegian Institute for Public Health reported a cluster of six monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium isolates sharing a rare multiple locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) type. The cases resided in five different municipalities in Norway and no travel abroad was reported in the week before symptom onset. Four initial cases were interviewed using a standardized 19-page Salmonella-specific trawling questionnaire. Following these interviews, the questionnaire was shortened to focus on categories of interest, which included domestic travel before symptom onset and food items eaten in cafes at Oslo Airport. All 21 cases reported having consumed food or drink at the cafe between Aug. 18 and Oct. 13, 2017. They had at least three different types of sandwiches and seven fruit or vegetable juices; no common food or drink was reported by all interviewed cases, who included cafe staff members. Cafe repeatedly closed and reopenedEnvironmental swabs and food specimens were collected by Mattilsynet during site inspection in September and environmental swabs in November 2017. Six environmental specimens taken from a kitchen drain, water tap and a wall mounted steel shelf were positive for the outbreak strain. All 10 food specimens were negative for Salmonella. ""The inspections identified several weaknesses in the hygiene routines at the cafe, including separation between clean and unclean kitchen areas, use of appropriate detergents for different cleaning purposes and which basins that should be used to wash hands, food items and dishes, respectively. Furthermore, the washing routines of workwear was not optimal and there was lacking assessment and management of potential risks connected with the work processes and ingredients,"" according to the study. In October, environmental samples collected by the company were analyzed at a private lab, sent to the Norwegian Veterinary Institute for verification and submitted to the NRL at NIPH for typing. The cafe operator provided documentation on wholesalers where they had sourced food with some of them outside Norway. On Sept. 22, the cafe closed temporarily before reopening on Oct. 13. The next day it closed again as preliminary results found Salmonella before reopening on Oct. 25. On Nov. 7, one specimen with suspected Salmonella was reported and the cafe closed again. New specimens collected on Nov. 8 and 15 tested negative and environmental specimens by Mattilsynet on Nov. 21 were also negative. Researchers said the company undertook control measures, including repeated voluntary closure, refurbishment of the kitchen and deep cleaning but eliminating the environmental contamination source proved difficult. ""This was likely due to the environmental contamination with specimens taken from several sites e.g. a kitchen drain, a tap and a steel shelf, all testing positive for the outbreak strain. The environmental inspection revealed several weaknesses in kitchen hygiene and food handling routines, possibly facilitating the cross-contamination of food items and protraction of the outbreak.""

The National Institute of Public Health (NIJZ), the Administration for Food Safety, Veterinary Sector and Plant Protection (UVHVVR) and the National Laboratory of Health, Environment and Food (NLZOH) investigated the outbreak in the town of Ilirska Bistrica. Officials said based on the clinical symptoms of patients, the duration of disease and results of laboratory tests, the cause of the illnesses was norovirus. Between Dec. 25 and 30, 2021, an outbreak of an infectious disease was detected in Ilirska Bistrica and 123 people became ill with at least one person being hospitalized. Most people infected suffered from vomiting and watery diarrhea but some also reported a fever, nausea and abdominal pain. Spread linked to packagingNorovirus was isolated as the causative agent in nine fecal samples from infected individuals. Bacillus cereus was also found in one fecal sample. The investigation showed that the source of infections was not food from a meat shop and it was also not staff, as norovirus was not isolated in employee fecal samples. It is thought the virus spread to the packaging in which the food was stored after contact with surfaces touched by infected customers. The possibility of previously infected people being responsible was not ruled out by NIJZ. Officials said one contributing factor was the fact that there were more people in the shop than normal. Norovirus is a very contagious virus that causes vomiting and diarrhea. People can get it from having direct contact with an infected person; consuming contaminated food or water or touching contaminated surfaces or objects and then putting putting their fingers in their mouths. A person usually develops symptoms 12 to 48 hours after being exposed and most people with the illness get better within 1 to 3 days. Norovirus can be found in vomit or feces before patients start feeling sick and can stay in feces for two weeks or more after patients feel better. Initial link to meatUVHVVR conducted an inspection at the shop linked to the outbreak at the end of December to try and find the cause. It was temporarily closed until the health of employees was assessed. The initial suspected source was consumption of meat products prepared and sold at the site including steak tartare as sick people all purchased food in the same shop in Ilirska Bistrica. Officials also did an epidemiological investigation, took swabs to check cleanliness of the implicated equipment and shop, did a medical examination of employees, took samples of suspected meat products from sick people and checked past inspections results. Thirteen people reported eating steak tartare from the shop and did not become sick. Twelve people said they did not eat any of the suspected foods but fell ill a day or two later. At least some of the illnesses are thought to have been caused by person-to-person transmission. Microbiological testing of steak tartare found all analyzed parameters were within acceptable limits. A stricter hygiene plan was proposed at the site involving work surfaces and equipment, which was carried out before the store reopened and no new infections have been reported since.

The edible fungus is also known as wood ear mushrooms. At least 41 patients are reported in the outbreak according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention outbreak announcement today. Many of them reported eating wood ear mushrooms in restaurants before becoming ill, according to the Food and Drug Administration. At least four people have required hospitalization. Wismettac Asian Foods Inc. has recalled the mushrooms. The California company reports distributing the implicated fungus to restaurants in 32 states and Canada. Federal officials in the United States and Canada, as well as state officials, are investigating to discover the source of the contamination of the Chinese mushrooms. Mushroom Council Senior Vice President Eric Davis says this recall is in no way related to fresh, cultivated mushrooms produced in the United States. He also stressed that fresh mushrooms are not implicated. California health officials found the Salmonella in samples of the edible fungus, spurring the company to initiate the recall. ""Wood ear mushrooms imported by Wismettac Asian Foods Inc. were only sold to restaurants and were not available directly to consumers. Although these items have been recalled, concerned or high-risk individuals should check with their restaurant to confirm that any wood ear mushrooms that have been used or are being used are not part of this recall,"" the FDA advised in an update today. Wood ear mushrooms are also commonly referred to as Kikurage, Dried Black Fungus, Dried Fungus, or Mu'er/Mu Er/Mu-Err, according to the CDC. The public health agency is advising anyone who has such food on hand to throw it away unless they know for sure it is not subject to the recall.

A review of records collected to date identified that Wismettac Asian Foods Inc., supplied wood ear mushrooms (dried fungus) to the illness cluster restaurants,"" according to the CDC's outbreak announcement posted today. ""The California Department of Public Health collected dried fungus at one of the restaurants linked to an illness cluster for testing. Testing identified Salmonella in a sample of dried fungus distributed by Wismettac Asian Foods Inc.

A wide range of people is listed as outbreak patients, with their illnesses having begun between Jan. 21 through Aug. 26, according to the CDC.  Ill people range in age from 2 to 74 years old. Of 32 ill people with information available, four hospitalizations have been reported. No deaths have been reported. Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of two to four weeks. About Salmonella infectionsFood contaminated with Salmonella bacteria does not usually look, smell, or taste spoiled. Anyone can become sick with a Salmonella infection. Infants, children, seniors, and people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of serious illness because their immune systems are fragile, according to the CDC. Anyone who has eaten any of the recalled mushrooms and developed symptoms of Salmonella infection should seek medical attention. Sick people should tell their doctors about the possible exposure to Salmonella bacteria because special tests are necessary to diagnose salmonellosis. Salmonella infection symptoms can mimic other illnesses, frequently leading to misdiagnosis. Symptoms of Salmonella infection can include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating contaminated food. Otherwise, healthy adults are usually sick for four to seven days. In some cases, however, diarrhea may be so severe that patients require hospitalization. Older adults, children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients, are more likely to develop a severe illness and serious, sometimes life-threatening conditions.

Those infected at the private event, about which no details were released, include two people from Sedgwick County and two from Harvey County. One of the four has seen the infection progress to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a serious complication in E. coli cases involving possible kidney failure and which usually strikes children. Kansas Department of Health and Environment spokeswoman Aimee Rosenow said state officials are investigating three other E. coli cases that appear to be unrelated to the four cases from the private event. Two of those other three were from Cowley County, where one person had both E. coli and HUS, while the other was solely an HUS case. The third case is from Nemaha County, where the individual was treated for both E. coli and HUS. It also unlikely that any of those three are connected to the recalled beef. Meanwhile, 20-year old Crystal Skram of Kansas City, MO, who got sick April 22 on vacation in Texas and where she was treated for both E. coli and HUS, was reportedly wondering if the source of her infection was the recalled beef. Skram spent 20 days in a Texas hospital before returning to Missouri. She went through having her kidneys shut down, fluid retention, and dialysis.

While health authorities have not been able to trace back the contaminated spinach to a specific farm, all of the food products used spinach processed by Coastal Green Vegetable Company, a vegetable processor based in Oxnard, CA. At least six food companies have issued voluntary recalls of products made using the suspected spinach. It's important to note that no illnesses have been connected to these products. However, due to the time required to trace an illness back to a specific food product, it is impossible to say whether or not any illnesses have occurred. The following is a list of all the products currently known to be under recall: 1. Amy's Kitchen products Amy's Kitchen Inc. recalled approximately 74,000 cases of products containing organic spinach.

That appears to be what has happened with Louisiana's Silliman Institute, where the original schedule for the term shows Easter break not beginning until today. However, Silliman sent students home last Friday, March 27, resumed classes Monday, March 30, and then called it quits until Monday, April 6. What gives? Silliman isn't talking and the answer is hard to find because Louisiana's Napoleonic Code is not about sunshine in government. ""There is an outbreak of STEC (Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli) in a school in Region 2 and it is being investigated,"" Ashley Lewis, spokeswoman for Louisiana's Department of Health and Hospitals, told Food Safety News. ""As the investigation progresses, the Department continues to take all necessary preventive measures to protect public health,"" Lewis noted, adding, ""Louisiana law prohibits the disclosure of the content of epidemiological investigations except to the institutions concerned. The Department would also clarify that any decisions related to facility closure have been made by the facilities themselves."" The answer about an apparent outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 appears to come from a Facebook group known to its members as HUS moms. They were first to report on a Clinton, LA, school closure last Friday. The school opened and closed again on Monday. The first child sickened in the Louisiana outbreak, a girl, was reportedly hospitalized with the kidney disease known as hemolytic-uremic syndrome, or HUS. The second child, also hospitalized but without HUS, was not being held in a pediatric intensive care unit and was likely going to avoid kidney dialysis. None of this was being shared, however, with the parents and students of Silliman Institute. The administration was getting the word out about the newly extended Easter break with a red-letter announcement on the school's website, but not explaining why. The announcement states: ""Silliman is closed Tuesday, March 31st and Wednesday, April 1st to extend the Easter break that is scheduled for Thursday, April 2nd through Monday, April 6th. We will resume regular schedule Tuesday, April 7th unless otherwise notified."" Silliman is a non-sectarian private school with a history that dates back 150 years.

The tally of laboratory-confirmed patients stands at 241, with sick people spread across 11 states. Six were so ill they had to be admitted to hospitals, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is unlikely that additional outbreak victims will be identified moving forward. ""In this fresh basil-associated cluster (of illnesses), there were several situations in which people reported eating at the same restaurants,"" the CDC reported. The cyclospora parasite that results in cyclosporiasis is often found on fresh produce that is generally consumed raw. Cilantro from Mexico routinely causes outbreaks from the parasite during the warmer months in the United States. Working with the Food and Drug Administration, investigators at the CDC traced the parasitic outbreak to fresh basil from Siga Logistics de RL de CV of Morelos, Mexico.

Some of the cases have been linked to drinking unpasteurized, or raw, milk, reports the Washington Times Herald. Bacteria such as E. coli O157, Campylobacter and Salmonella can contaminate milk during the process of milking dairy animals, including cows and goats. Animals that carry these germs are usually healthy. Pasteurization is the process of heating milk to a high enough temperature for a long enough time to kill illness-causing bacteria contained in the milk. Most people who become ill with campylobacteriosis get diarrhea, cramping, abdominal pain, and fever within two to five days after exposure to the organism. The diarrhea may be bloody and can be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The illness typically lasts about one week. Some infected persons do not have any symptoms. In persons with compromised immune systems, Campylobacter can spread to the bloodstream and cause a serious life-threatening infection. A substantial proportion of the raw milk-associated disease burden falls on children. The risk of getting sick from drinking raw milk is greater for infants and young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems -- such as those with cancer, an organ transplant, or HIV/AIDS -- than it is for healthy school-aged children and adults.

The 452 confirmed and suspected foodborne outbreaks affected 7,361 people, caused 705 hospitalizations and 18 deaths from 2013 to 2015. Salmonella was the main agent identified and restaurants were the most frequently-reported food preparation setting. There were 213 outbreaks attributed to a single food with 124 linked to consumption of eggs and egg-based dishes. A total of 129 outbreaks were recorded in 2013, 166 in 2014 and 157 in 2015. New South Wales reported the most in the period with 135. More than 90 outbreaks were caused by an unknown agent, according to data from OzFoodNet, Australia's foodborne disease surveillance system, published in the journal Communicable Diseases Intelligence. Salmonella was responsible for 239 outbreaks. Salmonella Typhimurium was the most commonly-identified serotype in all years, accounting for 90 percent of these incidents. Of outbreaks attributed to a single commodity, the foods mainly implicated were eggs followed by fish in 40 outbreaks and poultry in 27. During the reporting period, having contaminated raw products was a factor reported for 132 outbreaks followed by cross-contamination from raw ingredients 50 times. Large outbreak examplesTen outbreaks affected more than 100 people. Six were because of Salmonella Typhimurium, three because of norovirus, and one with 125 patients was suspected to have been caused by a bacterial toxin in curried prawns. The largest Salmonella outbreak sickened 350 people due to potato salad with raw egg mayonnaise. A 2013 norovirus outbreak that affected 525 people was linked to Tasmanian oysters. A leaking underwater sewer pipe was the suspected source of contamination. Overall, norovirus caused 35 outbreaks with 1,500 cases. Campylobacter was implicated in 18 foodborne outbreaks during 2013 to 2015. Six had strong associations with consumption of poultry liver. In 2014, the first locally-acquired outbreak of hepatitis E in Australia was identified and was related to consumption of pork liver pate at a restaurant. In 2015, the first outbreak of hepatitis A in the country linked to consumption of imported frozen berries was detected. Ciguatera fish poisoning was behind 29 outbreaks with 124 ill and eight were because of histamine with 31 patients.

The following product is subject to recall:   The product, bearing establishment number ""P-516"" inside the USDA mark of inspection, was shipped to an establishment for distribution nationwide. The problem was discovered by the Colorado Department of Agriculture during a routine retail surveillance and sampling program, which is funded by USDA at a Federal Emergency Response Network lab. After being notified of the positive test result, FSIS conducted traceback activities. Staphylococcal food poisoning is a gastrointestinal illness. It is caused by eating foods contaminated with toxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcus aureus is a common bacterium found on the skin and in the noses of healthy people and animals. Staphylococcus aureus can produce seven different toxins that are frequently responsible for food poisoning. Staphylococcal enterotoxins are fast-acting, sometimes causing illness in as little as 30 minutes. Thoroughly cooking a food product does not prevent illness, and symptoms usually develop within one to six hours after eating contaminated food. Patients typically experience several of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and diarrhea. The illness is usually mild, and most patients recover after one to three days. To prevent Staphylococcal contamination, keep kitchens and food-serving areas clean and sanitized. Keep hot foods hot (more than 140 degrees F) and cold foods cold (40 degrees F or lower). Make sure to wash hands and under fingernails vigorously with soap and water before handling and preparing food. Do not prepare food if you have an open sore or wound on your hands, or if you have a nose or eye infection.

Statens Serum Institut (SSI), the agency responsible for the preparedness against infectious diseases in Denmark, said the source of infection is not yet known but an investigation is under way. SSI told Food Safety News that the 26 confirmed patients' ages are between less than 1 year old to 95 years old, with 19 being children younger than five years of age. One person has been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Cases with a specific type of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) or Verotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC) have been reported to SSI in the past few weeks. E. coli O26:H11 illnesses are spread across the country, but are primarily in the cities of Copenhagen, Aarhus and Odense. Illness onset dates range from Aug. 23 to Oct. 10. From 2015-17, this O-group of E. coli was usually among the top four in terms of number of episodes in the country. The other E. coli bacteria in the top spots were O157, O103 and O146. Interviews to find the source of infection with cases or their parents are ongoing with Fodevarestyrelsen (Danish Veterinary and Food Administration) and DTU Fodevareinstituttet (DTU Food - National Food Institute). SSI said it had shared information with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). No other countries have confirmed cases related to the outbreak in Denmark. The outbreak strain causes relatively mild symptoms in most patients. It harbors the Shiga toxin (stx) 1a gene while hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is more often associated with strains that produce Stx2a. HUS is a severe complication of E. coli infection that can lead to kidney failure. The strain is resistant to ampicillin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. Such mild diarrhea cases normally don't need to be treated with antibiotics, but if they were these antibiotics would likely not be the first choice of medical practitioners. STEC is destroyed by cooking food until all parts reach a temperature of 70 degrees C or higher. Symptoms include abdominal cramps and diarrhea. The incubation period can range from three to eight days and most patients recover within 10 days. People at higher risk of severe infections, life-threatening complications and death include young children, frail and elderly people, pregnant women, and people such as cancer patients and pregnant because they have mature or weakened immune systems (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

""While it is theoretically possible the virus could be transmitted via food, based on everything we know, the risk of foodborne transmission is dramatically smaller -- perhaps by millions of times -- than the risk by airborne droplets,"" Donald W. Schaffner, extension specialist in food science and Distinguished Professor at Rutgers University, told Food Safety News.  Schaffner has done extensive research in quantitative microbial risk assessment, predictive food microbiology, handwashing and cross-contamination. He frequently works with Ben Chapman, professor and food safety specialist with the Department of Agricultural and Human Sciences at North Carolina State University. Chapman agrees that the risk of foodborne transmission of the coronavirus -- now sometimes being called COVID-19 -- is low. It hasn't been documented at all yet. But there are cross-contamination concerns. ""Since coronavirus is a respiratory virus we believe that it is contracted only by inhalation or similar mechanism (such as) sticking your finger in your nose, when your finger has a virus on it.  If it was in food it would be destroyed by proper cooking,"" Chapman told Food Safety News. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports the virus is generally spread person-to-person through respiratory droplets from sneezing, coughing and talking. ""Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food,"" according to the CDC. ""It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads."" There is a chance of cross contamination from hard surfaces such as door handles, cooking utensils, countertops and other items, but that danger is low, according to the CDC. "". . . because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures,"" the CDC reports. International health officials, who have declared the coronavirus outbreak a global threat, also say the chance of foodborne transmission is of small concern.  The virus has similar characteristics of SARS and MERS viruses, which are not spread through food. The World Health Organization reports there is not yet any evidence to support the theory that the virus is spread through food. Some concerns about food had been voiced when initial reports of the virus started coming out of China because the first patients had visited the same food market. Unlike some other viruses, such as norovirus and hepatitis A virus that survive in food, the coronaviruses cannot grow in food, according to international public health officials. The coronavirus needs an animal host, which includes humans, to grow. Recommendations for the single most effective weapon against the virus are a unanimous call for increased diligence in hand washing. ""The respiratory virus risk in restaurants is really more about being in the same location as a lot of people, some of who can be depositing the virus on surfaces like tables, doors, menus and managing that with a hand washing and alcohol-based sanitizer regime is an effective step to reduce risks of both COVID-19 and influenza,"" said Chapman.

Lennox Intl Inc, has recalled its Natural Pig ears because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella, according to a notice posted by the Food and Drug Administration. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working with the FDA and several state agencies on the outbreak investigation. According to the recall notice, the affected product comes in an 8 pack branded pouch under UPC ""742174 995163"" and ""742174994166"" or packaged individually shrinked wrapped under UPC ""0385384810"" and ""742174P35107.""

To date, Lennox said it is aware of two cases of its pig ears causing  dog Illnesses which may be related to the potential Salmonella contamination behind the  ongoing FDA investigation of  illness, associated with what appears to be  multiple sources. The Lennox recalled Natural Pig ear products were shipped to nationwide distributors and/or retail stores from May 1, 2019, to July 3, 2019. Salmonella can affect animals eating the pig ears, and there is further risk to humans from handling contaminated pet products, especially if they have not thoroughly washed their hands after having contact with the products. Any surfaces or utensils such as feeding bowls exposed to these products could be contaminated and should be cleaned and sanitized. Individuals infected with Salmonella should monitor for some, or all, of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and fever. Rarely, Salmonella can result in more serious ailments, including arterial infections, endocarditis, arthritis, muscle pain, eye irritation, and urinary tract symptoms. Anyone exhibiting these signs after having contact with this product should contact their healthcare providers. Pets with Salmonella infections may be lethargic and have diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, fever, and vomiting. Some pets will have only decreased appetite, fever, and abdominal pain. Infected but otherwise healthy pets can be carriers and infect other animals or humans. If your pet has consumed the recalled product and has these symptoms, please contact your veterinarian. About the investigationTo date, a total of 93 people from 27 states have been confirmed infected with the outbreak strains of Salmonella; 20 of those people have been reported hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Consumers can read more about the progression of the multistate outbreak here, and follow updates from the CDC's current investigation here. Recalled pig ear treats should be thrown into a secure container, so pets and other animals do not eat them. Even if a dog ate some of the recalled pig ears did not get sick, do not continue to feed them to your dog. Wash containers, shelves, and areas that held the recalled pig ear dog treats with hot, soapy water. A common supplier of pig ear treats in this outbreak has not been identified.

Information on the distribution of the implicated salad and the FDA's involvement in the outbreak investigation has been added below. One produce company is falling on its sword and another has become mum on the topic of an undisclosed Salmonella outbreak, meanwhile government officials are defending the decision to not inform the general public. Minnesota health officials confirmed Monday that they detected and investigated a Salmonella outbreak, beginning in April continuing into this month, that they linked to Taylor Farms Organic Kale Medley Power Greens sold at Sam's Club locations in the state. Federal officials also detected a person in Virginia sickened by the same strain of Salmonella and are monitoring the situation for additional victims. Seven people -- six in Minnesota and one in Virginia -- have been confirmed as all having Salmonella Enteritidis infections that have the same DNA fingerprint, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency did not post information on the multi-state outbreak or otherwise notify the public about it. ""In early May, Minnesota health officials notified CDC about an investigation into Salmonella infections in their state. CDC is monitoring PulseNet for any additional illness with the same DNA pattern nationally,"" CDC officials said Monday in an email response to questions from Food Safety News. ""It has been several weeks since the last illness occurred. If additional cases of illness are identified, CDC will work with states to obtain information about foods consumed before becoming ill."" The April-May outbreak was traced to a packaged organic salad product distributed nationwide to Sam's Club retail locations by Taylor Farms of Salinas, CA, said a spokesman for the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH). All six Minnesota victims reported eating Taylor Farms Organic Kale Medley Power Greens Mix before becoming ill. Neither the MDH nor the Minnesota Department of Agriculture posted outbreak information or otherwise notified the general public about the outbreak or their investigation of it. ""The illnesses began between April 3 and April 26. One person was hospitalized, and all are recovering,"" MDH Information officer Doug Schultz said Monday in response to questions from Food Safety News. A CDC spokeswoman referred questions about illness onset for the Virginia victim and that person's possible consumption of the implicated salad to state authorities, but Virginia state offices were already closed for the day. Schultz confirmed much of what Pacific Coast Fruit Co. posted in a May 6 notice on its website. The produce company intended the notice to inform its customers and employees that it had not handled any of the implicated salad, which Sam's Club quietly pulled from shelves across the country. ""Sam's Club was an extremely cooperative and proactive partner in the investigation; they pulled the implicated product from their store shelves nationwide on May 4 and directly notified all customers who had purchased the product in Minnesota since March 1,"" the MDH spokesman said. ""In summary, the vehicle for this outbreak was identified with a small number of cases and extremely quickly, and every person who purchased the implicated product was notified that the product might be contaminated with Salmonella. Because Sam's Club had the ability to directly notify all customers who had purchased the product, a press release was not necessary to reach those who had been exposed,"" Schultz said. Minnesota health officials notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about the outbreak and investigation in early May. The federal agency joined the investigation at that time, Schultz said. UPDATED CONTENT: What we still don't know A spokeswoman with the FDA responded to Food Safety News after this story was posted. She confirmed the agency's ongoing involvement in the outbreak investigation. She said FDA joined the investigation after receiving notification from Minnesota officials May 6.  ""FDA is currently aiding in this investigation by conducting a trace back investigation and additional follow-up activities as appropriate,"" said Siobhan DeLancey, team lead for strategic communications in FDA's Office of Foods and Veterinary Medicine. ""At this time, we do not have evidence that the product ill people report buying was distributed to any customers other than Sam's Club, nor has FDA identified any positive samples in the product. FDA will continue to work with CDC and state partners as the investigation is ongoing."" The FDA spokeswoman did not specifically address questions about why the agency did not issue a public warning or post an outbreak investigation notice. The chairman and CEO of Taylor Farms said a recall was not necessary. ""The FDA is not requiring any action from Taylor Farms and we are not issuing any formal recalls. We will continue to work with the MDH and MDA (Minnesota Department of Agriculture) regarding this issue,"" according to a statement Taylor Farms sent to trading partners on May 6 and provided to Food Safety News on May 15. Bruce Taylor, chairman and CEO of Taylor Farms, did not respond Monday to requests for additional information about the chronology of events related to the outbreak and investigation. Taylor did not reference Sam's Club or provide information on distribution of the implicated organic kale salad product. Sam's Club officials did not respond to requests for comment. Minnesota's health department spokesman said he could neither confirm nor deny reports that the implicated organic salad from Taylor Farms was exclusively distributed to Sam's Club locations. ""This would be a question better posed to FDA and/or Taylor Farms. All of the Minnesota cases were exposed to product purchased at Sam's Club locations,"" Schultz said. Putting the cat back in the bag Chances are the general public never would have known about the Salmonella outbreak and investigation had a Portland, OR, produce company not been trying to keep its trading partners and employees informed. Portland-based Pacific Coast Fruit Co. posted a notice about the outbreak and investigation on its website May 6, after being informed about the situation by Pro*Act -- a national network of local fresh produce distributors. Monday, officials with Pacific Coast Fruit Co. apologized for posting the notice, which included details about Sam's Club pulling the Taylor Farms products from shelves and used the word ""recall"" in relation to the situation. ""This was an unfortunate misstatement regarding a clearly indicated Alert being misread as a Recall. This misstatement was an oversight on Pacific Coast Fruit's part and we have reached out to our fellow industry partner, Taylor Farms, and apologized for the oversight,"" Pacific Coast Fruit vice president of manufacturing Dave Rothwell said in a written statement provided to Food Safety News and later posted on the company's website. ""Our apology was graciously acknowledged and accepted by Taylor Farm's leadership showing the strength of a long time partnership/relationship we have.

""We are all working tirelessly to identify and investigate all possible causes of this outbreak.

The illness usually lasts four to seven days. Most people recover without treatment. However, in some cases, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized.

Undeclared allergens caused 32 of the 87 recalls in 2019 while 30 were due to microbial contamination. In 2018, 46 recalls were because of allergens and 20 due to microbial contamination out of 100. Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) collects data on Australian food recalls so trends can be identified as well as common problems in the industry. Recalls are classified by FSANZ under microbial contamination, labelling, foreign matter, chemical/other contaminants, undeclared allergen, biotoxin and other. Undeclared allergen and microbial recalls upBetween January 2010 and December 2019, FSANZ coordinated 707 recalls. The average per year for the last 10 years is 71. The type mostly associated with a recall is mixed and/or processed food but this is likely due to the range in this category, including most long-life packaged food and manufactured items with multiple ingredients. Breads and bakery products, including biscuits, cakes and pastries, is the second largest type associated with recalls. For the last 10 years, most recalls have been due to undeclared allergens with 283 or 40 percent of all recalls during this period, and microbial contamination at 181 or 26 percent of all recalls. Recalls due to undeclared allergens continue to rise, however microbial ones are also increasing. Foreign matter recalls are decreasing. Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella and E. coli are most commonly associated with microbial food recalls. Meat, dairy and mixed and/or processed foods are the main items recalled due to Listeria monocytogenes contamination. There was an increase in Salmonella related recalls in 2019 due to multiple alerts for Salmonella Enteritidis. Recalls for Listeria decreased from 74 to 66 in the 10 year period. A range of foods are recalled due to Salmonella spp. contamination. Eggs and fruits, vegetables and herbs were the most common categories. Fruits, vegetables and herbs recalled were mainly lettuce, sprouts, rockmelon (cantaloupe), fresh parsley and dried herbs. Dairy products are more commonly recalled due to concerns with process hygiene, indicated through E. coli testing, than other categories. Other products recalled for E. coli include fresh sprouts, salads and mixed and/or processed foods. Other reasons for recallsDuring the last decade, undeclared milk has been the most common allergen related recall, making up 30 percent of all such recalls. Multiple allergens is the second most common type, accounting for 18 percent. Fourteen percent contained peanut as an undeclared allergen. The most common food type recalled due to undeclared allergens is mixed and/or processed food, accounting for 30 percent of all such recalls. This includes snack foods, custard powders and frozen meals. Confectionery was second with 14 percent and breads and bakery products third at 12 percent on the list. Between 2010 and 2019, there were 101 recalls due to foreign matter. The most common types found were metal, plastic and glass with only a few due to wood or rubber. Recalls due to biotoxins ranged over the past 10 years between one and 15 per year. The total number of recalls in this period was 41. Paralytic shellfish toxin found in oysters and mussels accounted for 63 percent of foods recalled. Next is hydrocyanic acid, a naturally occurring cyanide in tapioca chips and apricot kernels, with 17 percent of recalls. Histamine, aflatoxin, and ciguatera also featured in this category. The number of recalls due to chemical and other contaminants between January 2010 and December 2019 was 20. Other contaminants and cleaning and sanitizing agent contamination made up 35 percent and 30 percent of recalls while 15 percent were due to heavy metals.

Out of 63 for whom the information is available, more than half have been so sick they had to be admitted to hospitals.

Distributors are known to have distributed the implicated melon products to Costco, Jay C, Kroger, Payless, Owen's, Sprouts, Trader Joe's, Walgreens, Walmart, Whole Foods/Amazon. Other retail locations may be added to the list, the FDA reported. On June 8 Caito Foods LLC recalled some freshcut melon products and some individual retailers have followed suit, but there haven't been any recalls from other distribution channels.   ""The FDA has posted a list of stores and states where recalled pre-cut watermelon, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, and fruit medley products were sold. Additional stores and locations may be added as FDA receives more information,"" the CDC update said.  ""Do not eat recalled products. Check your fridge and freezer for them and throw them away or return them to the place of purchase for a refund. If you don't remember where you bought pre-cut melon, don't eat it and throw it away. ""Retailers should not sell or serve recalled pre-cut melon products distributed by Caito Foods Distribution, Gordon Food Service, and SpartanNash Distribution."" The FDA reported the implicated melon products have been distributed in: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin. States reporting illnesses and the number of case each has confirmed as of yesterday were: Illinois with 7; Indiana with 11; Kentucky with 1; Michigan with 38; Missouri with 10; Ohio with 2; and Tennessee with 1. Advice to consumersPublic health officials continue to remind consumers that it is particularly important for young children, adults older than 65, and pregnant women to avoid exposure to Salmonella because they are at higher risk of being infected.  Anyone who has eaten pre-cut melon recently and developed symptoms of Salmonella infection should seek medical attention and tell their doctors about the possible exposure. Specific tests are necessary to find Salmonella infections, which can be easily misdiagnosed as other illnesses. Most people infected with Salmonella develop signs and symptoms 12-72 hours after being exposed to the bacteria. Symptoms can include diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps. In some people, diarrhea may be so severe that they need to be hospitalized.  Salmonella infection may spread from the intestines to the bloodstream and then to other places in the body. In some cases, Salmonella infection can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics. The illness usually lasts about a week or less in healthy adults, but other groups are at a higher risk of developing serious infections and complications. High-risk people include children younger than 5 years, adults older than 65, and people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients, transplant recipients and HIV patients.

Reports of Campylobacter, cryptosporidium, E. coli, Listeria, Salmonella and Yersinia infections all declined in the past year with at least some of the drop attributed to the direct and indirect consequences COVID-19 has had on surveillance efforts and results. Disease surveillance is driven primarily by people seeking care and during the pandemic fewer patients have gone to primary care doctors with symptoms consistent with common zoonoses. This is thought to be related to patients choosing to not seek care and a true reduction in disease incidence related to changes in general hygiene such as increased handwashing, physical distancing and reduced travel because of coronavirus related recommendations. The report was prepared by the National Veterinary Institute (SVA) with help from Folkhalsomyndigheten (the Public Health Agency of Sweden) and Livsmedelsverket (the Swedish Food Agency). Record Campylobacter lowThe pandemic resulted in a record low of campylobacteriosis and a record high proportion of domestic infections. A total of 3,434 cases were reported, which was down from 6,693 in 2019. A large rise in the number of people infected with Campylobacter was noticed in early August. In parallel to this, several infections were observed in abattoir employees at a large slaughterhouse. There had also been an increase in the proportion of Campylobacter positive batches of chicken from the second half of July, mainly among flocks sent to the slaughterhouse. One reason cited for the spread among poultry flocks was dirty transport cages that carried the bacteria between chicken farms. A factor that may have made it easier for Campylobacter to gain a foothold at the farms is the practice of thinning, according to the report. Multi-year Listeria concernsDuring 2020, the incidence of listeriosis decreased compared to 2019 but the overall picture shows an increasing trend. In total, 88 confirmed cases were reported compared to 113 in 2019. Overall, 23 people died within one month from diagnosis. Fourteen different clusters were identified of which 13 contained identical or closely related isolates already seen before 2020. One listeriosis cluster included 19 cases with identical or nearly identical isolates identified since 2014 of which eight cases were in 2020. The majority are from two counties in northern Sweden which indicates the source of transmission is a locally made food product. Additional sampling at several producers was unable to find the outbreak strain. Another cluster included 26 cases with the same or similar isolates found since 2011 of which four cases were in 2020. The outbreak strain was found in blue cheese and ham sampled from the refrigerators of two patients in 2020, but the source is still unknown. A rare strain of Listeria monocytogenes in Sweden caused one illness linked to a locally produced cheese. A sample of washed rind cheese was collected from the refrigerator of the person and tested positive for the outbreak strain. The cheese was made from pasteurized milk. Analysis of environmental samples from the dairy showed the site and equipment were contaminated by the outbreak strain. Salmonella illness from domestic beefA total of 826 cases of salmonellosis were reported, compared to 1,993 in 2019. Domestic cases decreased by 45 percent from 763 in 2019 to 422 in 2020. The sharp decrease in domestic cases and the record low incidence likely reflects changes in behavior related to the pandemic. The most common serovars among domestic infections were Typhimurium, Enteritidis and monophasic Typhimurium. Another 55 serovars were identified during 2020. An increasing number of Salmonella infections linked to domestic beef have been observed. Between 2019 and early 2021, 27 cases belonging to four different outbreaks involving the serovars Agona, Dublin, Dusseldorf, and Reading have been investigated. Five cases with Salmonella Newport from late autumn were linked to an outbreak investigated by Norwegian authorities. The probable source of infection was iceberg lettuce. Only two outbreaks affected more than 10 people. One was caused by monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium, in which 17 people fell ill between September and November but the source of infection was unknown. The second was caused by the same types of Salmonella Typhimurium as were found among wild birds, cats and dogs and affected 20 people including 12 children. Long term STEC riseIn 2020, 491 E. coli cases were reported of which 396 were domestically acquired. The long-term trend for STEC infection in Sweden is rising but the figure fell from 756 in 2019. Shiga toxin producing-E. coli (STEC)-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) was reported in 10 cases of which eight were domestically acquired. Six HUS cases were children younger than the age of 10. For 56 percent of the domestically acquired STEC cases, an isolate could be serotyped. However, for the travel associated cases only 37 percent were typed. In total, 68 different serotypes were identified. The most common were O26:H11, O157:H7 and O103:H2. One national outbreak investigation was performed during 2020 with seven cases of O103:H11 but no source could be identified. Other pathogensA total of 641 cases of cryptosporidiosis were reported with more than 550 infected in Sweden. This is down from more than 1,000 infections in 2019. Many cases in January were a continuation of a national increase from late 2019 where different vegetables as sources of infections were investigated. During 2020, 220 Yersinia infections but no outbreaks were reported. This is the lowest incidence since at least 1997 and down from 393 in 2019. Seven cases of brucellosis were reported, which is less than the average of 13 in the past 10-year period. The low number can partly be explained by a reduction in travel abroad because of the pandemic so less imported infections. For three cases, unpasteurized dairy products were the probable source of infection. (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.) ",N/A,N/A,N/A,"Campylobacter, Listeria, Salmonella, E. coli, Cryptosporidium, Yersinia",N/A,Sweden5241," An outbreak of E. coli this past spring that sickened at least 12 people -- and hospitalized seven of them -- was caused by ground beef burgers cooked rare and medium-rare at restaurants, according to health department documents obtained by Food Safety News through records requests made over several months. This is the first time the exact cause of the outbreak, which occurred in April and May 2014, has been disclosed to the public. Public health experts speaking with Food Safety News say the outbreak is a stark reminder that undercooked ground beef poses a serious health risk and that consumers should be aware of the risk when ordering their burgers rare or medium-rare. The outbreak was first publicly reported by federal health authorities on May 19, 2014, with an announcement that ground beef produced by Detroit-based Wolverine Packing Company had sickened at least 12 people in 4 states. At the same time, the company and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a recall of 1.8 million pounds of ground beef produced by Wolverine between March 31 and April 18, 2014. In notices to the public, health agencies warned consumers against eating undercooked ground beef since cooking burgers to only rare or medium-rare does not kill potentially harmful bacteria such as E. coli that might be present in the center. The recommended temperature for beef burgers is 160 degrees F, according to the outbreak announcement from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). What the public health warnings did not spell out, however, was that the illnesses were all connected to undercooked burgers served at restaurants, including an Ohio ""gastropub"" chain specializing in medium-rare burgers. That chain is Bar 145. The name is a reference to what the company's website calls the perfect temperature for medium-rare burgers, 145 degrees F. Health department documents show that four of the five people sickened in the outbreak in Ohio ate medium-rare burgers at Bar 145 locations -- three at the Toledo restaurant and one in the city of Kent. They came down with E. coli infections within days, and the illnesses prompted a restaurant inspection that found the beef came from Wolverine. Each of the 12 people with confirmed cases told health officials that they ate burgers at restaurants within the outbreak window, with eight of them specifically noting that they ate rare or medium-rare burgers. For every laboratory-confirmed case of E. coli infection, CDC estimates another 26 cases go unreported. Documents also show that the cases are all connected by an uncommon variety of E. coli O157:H7, one seen only once before in PulseNet, the national epidemiological database. That evidence adds up to a ""really clear-cut"" outbreak caused by the burgers, said Carlota Medus, principal epidemiologist with the Minnesota Department of Health. ""It's extremely unlikely that these illnesses could have been caused by a different source, based on the evidence,"" she said. Two cases involved people who ate ""very rare"" burgers at Stella's Lounge in Grand Rapids, MI. That beef also came from Wolverine. Other patients ordered burgers from a brew pub in St. Louis, MO, a burger bar in Farmington, MI, and a steakhouse in Kent, OH, not connected to Bar 145. Each of the restaurants received Wolverine beef, although documents do not specify how those burgers were cooked. According to Dave Theno, the many risks associated with serving rare ground beef mean that restaurants need to take a number of additional safety precautions -- and these restaurants weren't doing them all. Theno is a food-safety consultant and former vice president of technical services at Jack in the Box, where he was hired to rebuild the fast-food chain's quality-assurance procedures following the 1993 E. coli outbreak from undercooked burgers that sickened hundreds of people and killed four children. ""Obviously, serving rare ground beef is just super ill-advised,"" he said.  Understanding the risk While there's nothing stopping consumers from ordering a rare burger, they should make sure they're well-informed about the risks beforehand, said Benjamin Chapman, associate professor of food safety at North Carolina State University. Chapman is currently leading a nationwide study to assess how well restaurants inform their customers about the risks of undercooked burgers. Restaurants that serve undercooked meat or seafood are required by the federal food code to provide a warning on their menus and have the server verbally inform customers when they want something considered risky. While the study is still underway, Chapman said that he believes adults should be able to order a burger cooked however they want as long as they're well-informed about the pathogenic risk. The jury is still out on whether or not they are. ""The thing that I'm most interested in is whether the advisory is useful,"" he said. ""Does someone who goes into a restaurant and orders an undercooked meat product -- are they given enough information to make a good decision based on their risk tolerance?"" That question gets more tricky when the customer is a child or an elderly person. Both demographic groups are more susceptible to illness and permanent injury due to their relatively weaker immune systems. ""The menu warning is a very weak control because you don't really have any control,"" said Roy Costa, owner of Environ Health Associates, a food-safety consulting firm for restaurants. Restaurants can't guarantee an adequate level of food safety when leaving it up to servers to inform customers and make decisions on who should or shouldn't eat a medium-rare burger, Costa said. Legal until someone gets sick The laws regarding serving undercooked ground beef put restaurants in a peculiar situation. While serving rare burgers is perfectly legal, it's illegal to serve a burger that's contaminated with E. coli. It's considered an adulterated, defective product. But there's no way for a restaurant to know that their beef is free of E. coli unless they take a number of major precautions. To start, restaurants need strict supplier control, Costa said. They should only buy beef from suppliers who perform microbial testing and provide certificates of analysis. On top of that, Costa recommends that the restaurants perform random testing of beef in addition to the supplier's testing to make sure the supplier is doing things right. When asked if he knew of any restaurants performing both those steps, Costa said he did not. He knows of one gastropub that does require certificates of analysis from its suppliers for its medium-rare burgers, but they don't perform their own additional testing, despite his recommendation. ""You just need to have a strong operation overall. No cross-contamination,"" Costa said. ""You have to show you can meet the food code from A to Z, with really good supplier control and a very active person at the counter who's empowered to decide who can and can't eat these burgers. That's the best you can do."" ""That, and carry a $10-million insurance policy,"" he added. Another option, Theno said, is to use cold-pasteurized beef. Through processes such as irradiation and electron-beam pasteurization, beef suppliers and restaurants can eliminate any bacteria and parasites from raw beef. They're then free to cook the beef however they like without the threat of sickening customers, he said. While some restaurants and grocery stores now offer cold-pasteurized beef, the practice is still far from mainstream. ""If you want to serve undercooked products like this, you've got to use cold-pasteurization,"" Theno said. Who's responsible? But what about the segment of the population who are fully aware of the risk and still want to enjoy a medium-rare, irradiation-free burger? If they get sick despite knowing the risk, are they responsible for their illness, or is the restaurant still on the line? Legally speaking, the restaurant is ultimately responsible. The disclaimers on the menu won't absolve anyone in court, Theno said. ""If someone wants to buy ground beef, take it home and cook it rare, that's a personal choice,"" he said. ""But as soon as someone walks in my restaurant, I take responsibility for their health."" Even if restaurants cook food to order, they're legally not allowed to sell products considered defective, which would include a contaminated burger, Costa added. Word travels fast through the food-safety world, and Theno said that when he heard about Bar 145 and their connection to the outbreak, he tried to get in touch with the owners to give them some advice, but he couldn't get a return call. Food Safety News also contacted Bar 145's Toledo location and spoke with a manager, but the owners did not return a call looking for comment. Ultimately, Costa said, consumers are the ones who risk illness and injury from a contaminated burger, and everyone should do the best they can to educate themselves on the risks and make informed choices. ""You have to make a decision as a consumer if you're going to expose yourself to a potentially life-threatening infection,"" he said. ""My advice is to do what you want, but understand what the risk is. Make an intelligent decision."" Theno, on the other hand, placed the final responsibility on restaurant owners. ""Short of pasteurization, there's no way to guarantee that there aren't harmful microbes in ground beef,"" he said. ""Restaurant owners have a responsibility to protect public health and ensure no one gets sick from your products. They'll tell you they have it under control, but they don't.""

In 2020, there were 559 outbreaks with 1,907 patients reported. This is less than 756 outbreaks affecting 2,805 people in 2018 and 735 outbreaks sickening 3,058 in 2019. Norovirus, Salmonella and Campylobacter are still the cause of most outbreaks, but at a much lower level than previous years. Eight Campylobacter outbreaks were recorded, five for Salmonella and three for norovirus. There were three Listeria outbreaks and one each for Bacillus cereus, Ciguatera and Shigella. The agent was unknown for 537 outbreaks. The decrease is primarily because of the coronavirus pandemic and measures taken to reduce its spread, such as handwashing, increased hygiene, temporary closure of catering firms and reduced contact because of lockdowns, according to the report. Figures come from the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA) and the municipal public health services (GGDs) and were published by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM).

Five people across three outbreaks also died of listeriosis compared to an overall number of 53 hospitalizations and six deaths in 2019. The largest outbreak was because of norovirus with 63 sick, followed by 56 patients in a Salmonella outbreak and 43 patients in an incident with an unknown agent. Overall, Salmonella outbreaks affected 87 people, norovirus events had 85 patients, Campylobacter was responsible for 26 patients and Listeria 24 patients. The Bacillus cereus outbreak had three patients, a Ciguatera outbreak involved five people and four were ill in the Shigella outbreak. In two of the 22 outbreaks in which a germ was detected, it involved a pathogen in food. Bacillus cereus was found in a frozen tuna burger and signs of Ciguatoxin were detected in red snapper fish. Listeria monocytogenes was found three times in samples that, thanks to whole genome sequencing, was linked to patients. In all three, contamination occurred during production or processing and was linked to fish on two occasions and once to soft cheese. In the Netherlands, the cheese outbreak involved six people from June 2019 to December 2020 and 18 more patients from three other countries between June 2019 and January 2021. Goat's cheese was recalled in late 2020 after environmental Listeria contamination. The company took steps to improve hygiene and control the pathogen with no sick people reported since. Salmonella, Campylobacter and Ciguatera outbreaksIn 17 outbreaks, a pathogen was only found in the patient. A Salmonella Enteritidis outbreak with 56 patients in August 2020 was linked to Turkish pizza from one catering business. The incident initially affected an institution for the mentally and physically disabled but more cases have been identified in the community since July by WGS. No Salmonella was found at the outlet and which ingredient was contaminated is unknown.  Salmonella was found at the raw material producer for the chicken doner but it was a different type. Preparation sites of suspected food were mainly restaurants and cafeterias. In half of the outbreaks the food under suspicion was eaten at home and in just under half it was consumed at the same location as it was prepared. In July 2020, two people in the same family fell sick from Campylobacter after drinking unpasteurized milk bought from a farm but no Campylobacter was found in milk samples at the site. Campylobacter jejuni was detected in the stool of one of the patients. Raw milk offered for sale must bear a statement that it is to be boiled before consumption. It is not known whether the patients boiled the milk before drinking it. In May, a group of five people ate fish and fell ill with Ciguatera poisoning a few hours later. The red snapper, from India, was bought at a shop and prepared at home. Leftovers from the freezer of one patient were tested and suspected to be above internationally established limits.

Hundreds of grade school students were taken to two provincial hospitals as they experienced stomach aches and vomiting, just after eating their government-provided school lunches. Ambulances, school buses and even taxis were used to get the students to hospitals. Then it got worse. More than 1,000 students of all ages from as many as 10 schools had to be taken to two provincial hospitals, Bhisho and Gray. The dramatic event brought out Eastern Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle, Health MEC Phumza Dyantyi and Education MEC Mandla Makupula on the following morning to visit casualty wards at the two hospitals where the children were being treated for severe diarrhea. The food poisoning incident began with hundreds of grade schoolers from the Schornville Primary School in King Williams Town. On the school lunch menu, according to the Eastern Cape Department of Education, was a ""crumbly porridge"" known locally as ""umphokoqo,"" which may have made with ""expired sour milk."" The grade school -- with 1,200 students enrolled -- has confirmed the students likely suffered from food poisoning and an investigation involving both food and water sources is underway. They hope the investigation will confirm where the food poisoning originated. Samples of sour milk, water and other foods have already been collected by health officials investigating the outbreak. Students were still being admitted to the two hospitals into the evening hours. One school official said some students began complaining about stomach aches even before going to lunch. Many parents kept their children home from school on Thursday and schools called for meetings with parents on Friday. (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.) ",N/A,crumbly porridge (umphokoqo),Expired sour milk,Food poisoning,"More than 1,000 students","King Williams Town, South Africa"5124,"Two days have been set aside this week to resolve remaining pre-sentence issues in the Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) criminal case being heard in federal court in Albany, GA. While this is the most significant criminal food safety case to ever be tried in the United States, it's gone on so long that some people may have forgotten why it's so important and just what happened. Today, Food Safety News provides a timeline summary of the events that brought us to this day. Tomorrow, as the case resumes in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia, we'll look at its significance and what's happening now that it is finally nearing the end. Here's the timeline from the beginning until now: The Outbreak (Sept. 6, 2008, to April 18, 2009): The onset of Salmonella Typhimurium infections in the U.S. spanned seven months. Before the outbreak ended, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officially recognized 714 cases, but the agency noted that, for every confirmed case, it was likely that at least 30 more went unreported. This means as many as 20,000 people may have been sickened by the contaminated peanut butter. The outbreak is blamed for nine deaths. The Recall (Jan. 9, 2009, through the end of the year): PCA ceased production and shipment of peanut butter and peanut paste from its Blakely, GA, processing plant on Jan. 9, and the recalls that began then would continue for most of the year. PCA ceased operations at its Plainview, TX, plant on Feb. 10. The recalls were not only for peanut butter packaged by PCA. More than 200 companies recalled a total of 3,918 products which included PCA peanut butter or peanut paste as an ingredient. It is likely the most expensive recall over a single ingredient in U.S. history. The Political Storm (High point: February 2009): During the peanut butter scare, America acquired a new president, and it was very early in his first term that Barack Obama stepped up to speak for almost all parents when he said: ""At a bare minimum, we should be able to count on our government keeping our kids safe when they eat peanut butter. That's what Sasha eats for lunch,"" Obama said, referring to his then 7-year-old daughter. ""Probably three times a week. I don't want to worry about whether she's going to get sick as a consequence of eating her lunch."" Stewart Parnell But a week later, parents did not get much in the way of reassurance when former PCA owner Stewart Parnell was called to testify before Congress because he invoked his right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. ""I respectively decline to answer your question,"" Parnell said. However, his words were entered into the record in the form of emails turned up by congressional investigators. To his managers who asked him what they should do with product that tested positive for Salmonella, he responded with orders to, ""Turn them loose,"" or a similar phrase. To Congress, Parnell came across as being only concerned about how much money it was costing him to delay shipments after positive Salmonella tests and wait for re-testing. The work of the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations was enough to cause the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) to raid the Blakely plant and announce that a federal investigation was underway. Civil Litigation (2009-2011): Wrongful death and injury lawsuits for the most serious damage done by PCA products were filed by top plaintiff attorneys. The company had some liability insurance and $12 million was distributed Sept. 1, 2010, under a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for Western Virginia as part of PCA's bankruptcy proceedings. Other companies, such as Kellogg's, which were also sued in their capacity as users of PCA ingredients in their products, settled those cases. The Investigation (Feb. 2009 to Feb. 2013): A federal investigation leading to grand jury indictments took four years, with only occasional acknowledgement that it was continuing.   The FBI, the Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI) at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Department of Justice's Consumer Protection Branch, and the U.S. District Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia were the cooperating agencies in the federal probe. During the four-year-long investigation, government officials said hardly anything on or off the record, although Virginia defense attorney Thomas J. Bondurant Jr. did tell local media outlets that he had a new client: Stewart Parnell. The Indictment (Feb. 21, 2013): PCA again dominated the news when a 76-count indictment was unsealed charging four of the defendants with mail and wire fraud and the introduction of adulterated and misbranded food into interstate commerce with the intend to defraud or mislead. The same day, those four defendants learned that Daniel Kilgore, former operations manager at the Blakely plant, had pleaded guilty to mail and wire fraud, the introduction of adulterated and misbranded food into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud or mislead, and conspiracy. The PCA plant in Blakely, GA. As they were being booked, Stewart Parnell and his brother, peanut broker Michael Parnell, former Blakely plant manager Samuel Lightsey, and former quality control manager Mary Wilkerson must have known Kilgore would testify for the government at their trial over a scheme to manufacturer and ship Salmonella-contaminated peanuts and peanut products, thereby misleading customers, including global, multi-billion-dollar food companies. Before the federal criminal charges were handed down, PCA had ceased to exist through bankruptcy proceedings that liquidated the company. Senior U.S. District Court Judge W. Louis Sands, a former chief judge for the Middle District of Georgia, got the case assignment. He released the defendants to assist in their own defenses, with minimal bond requirements. The government and the multiple defense attorneys now involved agreed it is a ""complex case"" and waive the speedy trial rule. Pre-Trial  (Feb. 2013 to July 2014): The 17-month period before the jury trial began is mostly remembered for two developments. Through his defense attorneys, Stewart Parnell tried unsuccessfully to create a defense around his claimed condition of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The issue went to a so-called ""Daubert"" hearing before Judge Sands, who listened to arguments for and against ADHD as a defense before tossing it. The Trial (mid-July to mid-September 2014): A 12-member jury with six alternates heard the testimony, mostly put on by the prosecution. While taking full advantage of cross-examination, the defense used less than one day to present its case. The jury convicted all three defendants. Wilkerson was found guilty on one of two counts of obstruction of justice with which she was charged, while the Parnell brothers were found guilty on a total of 97 federal felony counts. Senior U.S. District Court Judge W. Louis Sands The prosecution immediately demanded that Stewart and Michael Parnell be taken into custody until they were able to put up cash bails of $150,000 and $100,000, respectively. Sands set a 30-day deadline for post-trial appeals. Post Trial (mid-September 2014 to present): After holding closed-door hearings and taking several months to write his decision, Sands rejected calls by the defense to either have the verdicts set aside or for a new trial. The most serious post-trial accusation was that some jurors had discussed the fact that the outbreak had caused the deaths of some victims and that they had failed to disclose their knowledge of the deaths or their opinion about it during jury selection. Sands re-interviewed almost all the jurors under the threat of perjury and was able to determine the charges of jury misconduct did not occur. The only juror he was concerned with was the one who accused the others. The judge's investigation into the conduct of the jury was largely carried out behind closed doors, with related documents sealed from the public. In the next two days, Sands is expected to resolve all outstanding pre-sentence issues, including restitution and challenges to pre-sentence investigative reports. After that, only the actual sentencing of the five defendants will remain.  (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.) ",Peanut Corporation of America (PCA),Peanut butter and peanut paste,Salmonella contamination,Salmonella Typhimurium infections,"20,000","Blakely, GA and Plainview, TX"2503,"Spanish officials have said steps taken in response to more than a dozen Salmonella infections were ""sufficient and proportionate"" to protect public health. Two outbreaks affected 14 people at two elderly care homes in Madrid late this past year and were linked to chicken burger meat. No information has been made public about the patients, such as their ages or severity of their illnesses. The Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition (AESAN) said that because the supply chain of the products involved wholesale and they were not directly sold to the final consumer, the information about the incident was sent via official control channels and it was not considered necessary to publically warn about the existence of items in the market that may have posed a risk to health. This means names of the firms involved have been kept private. In late December 2021, consumer group FACUA called for the companies involved to be named and details released to identify the contaminated meat to prevent more people from becoming ill. The association wrote to AESAN and the Ministry of Health in Madrid about the lack of transparency given the potential seriousness of the situation. Used in wholesale and not sold to the publicAESAN said it believes that the steps taken were ""sufficient and proportionate"" to protect the health of the public, considering the details of the incident. A food alert was received on Dec. 7, 2021, from officials in Madrid, because of the presence of Salmonella in a product made with chicken burger meat after taking samples of several foods that would have been consumed by the affected people. A Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) notification was posted on the same day that lists Malta and Portugal as receiving the meat and an operator in Ireland as being involved. Investigations in Spain have been carried out at the manufacturing company to verify the safety of products it sells, according to officials. This company and a distribution business have notified their customers about the issue so that products can be withdrawn from the market and destroyed. According to information available to AESAN, the product was distributed through wholesale channels in 6.8 kilogram packages, and is used for further processing. It is not sold directly to consumers via retailers. AESAN added that if there was any new information that could have an impact on public health it would be communicated by the agency.

",N/A,Chicken burger meat,Presence of Salmonella,Salmonella infections,14,Madrid1941,"Eight people are part of a Salmonella outbreak in Ireland linked to pork from Romania. Five of them were admitted to hospitals. Infected people also have been identified in other countries. One person was sickened by Salmonella Bredeney in August 2018. The other seven people fell ill between May 4 and June 3, this year. Those stricken are six adult males and two children who are siblings. There have not been any deaths. Pork product recall In mid-July, Andromi Toba de Casa 500-gram packages with a use-by date of Aug. 4 and with the lot number 17 from Romania were recalled because of the presence of Salmonella. The chilled cooked pork preparation is sold in Polonez stores throughout Ireland. A spokeswoman from the Health Service Executive (HSE) in Ireland told Food Safety News that the Salmonella strain in the recalled food product was the one identified in people who have been infected in the outbreak. ""However, the batch of food product that was tested did not cause illness in the people who are sick as part of this outbreak, as it was produced at the end of June 2019, after the most recently ill person in the outbreak developed symptoms."" A multi-disciplinary outbreak control team was established to investigate with representatives from regional Departments of Public Health, HSE-Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), the reference laboratory, Public Health Laboratory, Environmental Health Services and Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI). In a statement to Food Safety News, FSAI officials said several lines of inquiry are being followed. ""The FSAI was informed by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre of an outbreak of foodborne illness in Ireland caused by Salmonella Bredeney. A multi-agency, multi- disciplinary Outbreak Control Team (OCT) was established and is chaired by the HPSC. FSAI is a part of the OCT which is investigating the outbreak and following various lines of inquiry, including potential links with products from Romania. The investigation is ongoing."" Timeline of outbreakThe outbreak control team has linked with public health and food safety authorities in Romania and European agencies because some cases have been identified in other EU countries. Distribution of the product also included the United Kingdom and the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) is involved. ""The HSE's National Salmonella Reference Laboratory service found that the genetic sequence of Salmonella from three different people who were ill due to Salmonella at about the same time were almost exactly the same,"" said the HSE spokeswoman. ""The reference laboratory brought this to the attention of the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre, who alerted regional departments of public health. In a short period after this first alert the reference lab found a number of other Salmonella with the same genetic sequence. On review of reference lab records, one case from 2018 was also identified with the same sequence. ""Where language barrier is an issue in patient interviews, the HSE has access to an interpreter service. This service was used to interview some cases associated with this outbreak."" Only zero to five cases of this serotype of Salmonella have been recorded annually in Ireland from 2010 to 2018. ""However the full genetic sequence gives a lot more detail than the serotype. Salmonella of this serotype with this exact genetic sequence has not been detected in Ireland other than in the recent cases, the case in 2018 and the food product,"" said the HSE spokeswoman. Information about Salmonella infectionsFood that is contaminated with Salmonella bacteria usually does not look, smell or taste spoiled. Anyone can become sick with a Salmonella infection, but infants, children, seniors and people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of serious illness because their immune systems are fragile, according to the CDC. Anyone who has eaten any of the implicated pork products and developed symptoms of Salmonella infection should seek medical attention. Sick people should tell their doctors about the possible exposure to Salmonella bacteria because special tests are necessary to diagnose salmonellosis. Salmonella infection symptoms can mimic other illnesses, frequently leading to misdiagnosis. Symptoms of Salmonella infection can include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating contaminated food. Otherwise healthy adults are usually sick for four to seven days. In some cases, however, diarrhea may be so severe that patients need to be hospitalized.  Older adults, children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients, are more likely to develop a severe illness and serious, sometimes life-threatening conditions. It is possible for some people to be infected with the bacteria and to not get sick or show any symptoms, but to still be able to spread the infection to others.

All cases report eating undercooked or raw chicken livers; most cases consumed chicken livers prepared as pate. The cases in Ohio ate chicken liver pate while visiting Oregon. One Washington resident was sickened by chicken liver pills. The Oregon Health Authority is working with USDA and CDC on the investigation. Terry reports that the chicken livers were processed at Draper Valley Farms in Mt. Vernon, WA. One person ate chicken liver pate at the Heathman; another dined at Wildwood; the third Oregonian purchased chicken liver pate prepared and sold by a Market of Choice store. Draper Valley did not issue a recall. Under U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations, processors are allowed to sell chicken livers tainted with a high level of Campylobacter. This is the second reported multistate outbreak of campylobacteriosis associated with consumption of undercooked chicken liver in the United States. Chicken livers should be considered a risky food. A recent study found up to 77 percent of chicken livers tested were positive for Campylobacter. Washing chicken livers is not enough; chicken livers can be contaminated on the inside and on the outside, which is why thorough cooking is the only way to kill bacteria in contaminated livers. Pate made with chicken liver is often undercooked to preserve texture. It can be difficult to tell if pate is cooked thoroughly because livers are often partially cooked then blended with other ingredients and chilled. Pate prepared at a USDA-inspected facility is considered safe to eat because, in order to pass inspection, the livers must be cooked to a proper temperature. Healthy persons infected with Campylobacter often experience diarrhea, headache and body ache, cramping, abdominal pain, and fever within two (2) to five (5) days after exposure to the organism. The diarrhea may be bloody and can be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The illness typically lasts one (1) week and some infected persons do not have any symptoms. In persons with compromised immune systems Campylobacter occasionally spreads to the bloodstream and causes a serious life threatening infection.

They were sold by Christchurch business Ethnic Market in Linwood. Sale of raw apricot kernels is prohibited under New Zealand food law. Those admitted to the hospital as a precaution have since been discharged after eating the raw kernels. Ethnic General Trade Company Limited trading as Ethnic Market has recalled all batches and dates of Ethnic Market brand Apricot Pites (raw apricot kernels). The dried fruits and seeds come in a 500-gram bag. Product tracing ongoingMelinda Sando, Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) national manager of food compliance, said the kernels have been removed from sale at Ethnic Market while the product is traced to see where else it is available. ""In the meantime, we are advising that if people have purchased these kernels they should throw them out, or return them to the place where they were bought. Raw apricot kernels contain a naturally occurring toxin that can break down to release cyanide when eaten. This can be harmful depending on the amount consumed,"" she said. It can cause a range of symptoms a few hours after ingestion from nausea, stomach aches, headaches, and respiratory issues through to cardiac arrest, depending on the amount eaten and can be serious, especially in children. Regulated productApricot kernels contain a naturally occurring toxin called amygdalin which converts to cyanide after eating. Fresh apricots with the stone inside can still be sold and eaten. Apricot kernels are safe to eat in processed products, like almond biscuits, as the baking process reduces levels of the toxin. They resemble small almonds and have an almond-like taste. A 2016 European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) opinion found eating more than three small raw apricot kernels, or less than half of one large kernel, in a serving can exceed safe levels. Some sellers promote them as a cancer-fighting food and promote intake of 10 and 60 kernels per day for the general population and cancer patients, respectively. According to European Commission Regulation No. 2017/1237, apricot kernels must not contain more than 20 milligrams per kilogram of hydrocyanic acid. Health Canada established a regulatory maximum level for total cyanide in apricot kernels sold as food. This also applies to apricot kernels used as an ingredient in other foods and came into effect in January this year. The limit is 20 parts per million (ppm) total extractable cyanide in apricot kernels sold for human consumption. (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

Nutripack is owned by Brett Sher, son of Joel and Holly Sher, who own Evanger's. Joel Sher is listed as manager of the Nutripack operation. The two facilities are located about 50 miles apart.   The FDA investigation was initiated when five dogs in one household developed symptoms of barbiturate poisoning after eating Evanger's Hand Packed Hunk of Beef au Jus. Four of the five dogs required veterinary ICU hospitalization, and one of those four dogs died. According to a spokesperson from FDA, the agency has received several additional complaints associated with pets that have been fed Evanger's dog food. Some of those complaints are of a general nature, however, some complainants report symptoms possibly associated with pentobarbital toxicity. FDA has briefed its Consumer Complaint Coordinators on the Evanger's situation and urges pet owners and veterinarians to report any concerns via the agency's How To Report A Pet Food Complaint web page. The agency is especially interested in cases where pets received a veterinary work-up and their owners still have cans of food available for testing by FDA. The Inspectional Observations report, FDA Form 483, confirms that Evanger's Hand Packed Hunk of Beef au Jus in 12-ounce cans with the code 1816E06HB13, and Against the Grain brand Grain Free Pulled Beef with Gravy Dinner for Dogs in 12-ounce cans with the code 2415E01ATB12 BEST DEC 2019 both contained the barbiturate drug pentobarbital. Tests carried out by USDA confirmed that the meat used in the canned pet foods was beef. According to FDA's report, the agency ""...was unable to determine from available records whether any other Evanger's or Against the Grain products made with beef contain any of the beef that went into the recalled products."" Pentobarbital, a controlled substance, is used as a chemical euthanasia agent by veterinarians and pet shelters. FDA report shows numerous problems at production plantsAccording to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, a food ""... shall be deemed to be adulterated if it bears or contains any added poisonous or added deleterious substance that is unsafe..."" A food also is considered to be adulterated under the Act ""... if it has been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.""  The list of violations and deficiencies found during the recent inspection visits fall under both of these definitions: Evanger's previous violationsThis is not Evanger's first brush with FDA, nor is this the first time that an inspection has turned up instances of insanitary conditions, poor temperature control, and deficiencies in plant construction and design. A summary of results from an inspection completed on Dec.5, 2011, included the following observations: A subsequent inspection, completed in November 2012 revealed that some of the issues still lingered, and new ones were documented, including: Evanger's has long advertised that all of its suppliers of meat products are ""USDA approved."" During the most recent inspection, FDA found evidence to the contrary. Specifically, the investigation team found a bill of lading from Evanger's supplier of beef that listed ""Inedible Hand Deboned Beef - For Pet Food Use Only. Not Fit For Human Consumption."" FDA has established that the supplier in question does not have a ""grant of inspection"" from USDA. The meat from this supplier does not bear the USDA inspection mark. The meat does not, under any circumstances, qualify as human-grade, a term that Evanger's has used to describe its meat ingredients since at least June 2003. Evanger's practice could result in allegations of false or deceptive advertising, and require the pet food makers to deal with the Federal Trade Commission. Actions consumers can take on their own The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is tasked with the enforcement of the nation's truth-in-advertising laws. ""The FTC looks especially closely at advertising claims that can affect consumers' health or their pocketbooks - claims about food, over-the-counter drugs, dietary supplements, alcohol, and tobacco and on conduct related to high-tech products and the Internet,"" according to the FTC website. The FTC has several remedies at its disposal, including filing actions in federal court to stop perpetration of scams and to obtain compensation for victims. FTC and FDA cooperation in bringing companies making false claims to heel is common, especially against those who market phony supplements and medical devices. In addition to that work, and that of USDA, there are some actions consumers can take on their own, including: 1. Return any and all recalled product to the place of purchase, or directly to the manufacturer. 2. Consider switching to a different brand of pet food. 3. If you believe that your pet has been made ill as a result of consuming Evanger's or any other pet food, please visit the FDA web page: How to Report a Pet Food Complaint. 4. If your pet has been examined by a veterinarian who believes that an illness may be food related, urge your veterinarian to report the incident via the federal Safety Reporting Portal. 5. If you purchased an Evanger's meat-based food on the understanding that all of the meat in the company's products is sourced from ""USDA approved"" suppliers, you can file a formal complaint of false advertising on the Federal Trade Commission website.

Out of 825 samples of seeds, water and finished sprouts tested, officials found Salmonella or Listeria contamination in only 14. None of the samples were positive for E. coli, but only finished sprouts and water were tested for that pathogen, not seeds, according to the Food and Drug Administration. The 14 positive samples came from eight of the 94 growing operations included in the project, and 10 of the positives came from just four growers. FDA collected the samples from February 2014 through September 2015. Of the 825 samples, 608 came from growing operations, 101 from distributors and 116 from retailers across 37 states, Puerto Rico and Washington D.C. In a report released Friday, the FDA detailed the procedures used and resulting data generated during the special ""sampling assignment"" that began in 2014 and was planned to last two years. ""About one year into the assignment, the FDA decided to stop its collection and testing at 825 samples because it had already collected samples on more than one occasion from many of the sprouting operations known to the agency and its state partners,"" according to the report. The FDA designed its sampling plan such that if contamination of one percent or greater was present in the commodity, the agency would detect it, according to the report. The agency targeted fresh sprouts for the sampling program because they have been the source of many foodborne illness outbreaks in recent years. ""Sprouts are especially vulnerable to pathogens given the warm, moist and nutrient-rich conditions needed to grow them,"" according to the FDA report. ""From 1996 to July 2016, there were 46 reported outbreaks of foodborne illness in the United States linked to sprouts. These outbreaks accounted for 2,474 illnesses, 187 hospitalizations, and three deaths."" The FDA tested 14 different varieties of fresh sprouts during the project. The most frequently collected sprouts and the percentages of the total samples were mung bean at 36 percent, alfalfa at 21 percent, clover at 10.4 percent, and soybean at 10.4 percent. Other sprout varieties collected during the sampling project include adzuki bean, broccoli, kale, mustard seed, onion, pea, radish, snow pea, sunflower, and wheat. In addition, 5 percent of the samples collected were described as ""mixes,"" meaning they contained two or more varieties. The FDA estimates that about 55 million pounds of fresh sprouts are produced annually in the United States. The growing operations included in the special sampling project ranged in production from 25 pounds per week to 280,000 pounds per week. In the sampling project, the agency was specifically looking for E. coli, Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes bacteria. During the project, FDA identified an ongoing Listeria monocytogenes outbreak, that killed two people. The implicated grower stopped production and recalled product. The business ultimately closed down. ""The FDA worked with the firms that owned or released affected sprouts to conduct voluntary recalls or to have their consignees destroy affected product, and then followed up with inspections. The agency also referred its findings to state authorities in two cases,"" according to the report. Other specific findings from the sampling project include: Moving forwardThe FDA will continue to study microbial contamination of sprouts and how best to reduce it, according to the report. Going forward, the FDA intends to inspect sprouting operations to ensure they are complying, as applicable, with the Produce Safety Rule, which includes new requirements for sprouts growers. The agency has no plans to conduct additional large-scale sampling of sprouts at this time but may sample the commodity in accordance with its longstanding approach to food sampling, which centers on, but is not limited to, the following criteria: A firm has a previous history of unmitigated microbial contamination in the environment (e.g., human illness, recalled or seized product, previous inspectional history, or environmental pathogens without proper corrective actions by the facility), or Inspectional observations that warrant collection of samples for microbiological analyses.

Inc. recalled almost 150 freshcut vegetable products nationwide in both countries because of a positive test showing Listeria contamination. The recall includes a wide variety of ""minimally processed vegetable products"" packaged under several brands, including Mann's, Trader Joe's Walmart and others. A random test by Canadian officials showed Listeria monocytogenes contamination of one of the products. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency notified Mann Packing of the test result on Tuesday. Consumers are urged to check their homes for unused portions of the recalled products and immediately dispose of them or return them to the place of purchase. ""Mann Packing is issuing this recall out of an abundance of caution. To date, public health officials have not reported any illnesses associated with these products,"" according to the news release from the Salinas, CA, produce company. Mann distributed the recalled products throughout the United States and Canada. They have ""best if used by"" dates from Oct. 11 through Oct. 20 listed on the front of the packaging. A complete list of the recalled products distributed at retail and foodservice, including product names, brands, UPC codes and ""best if used by"" dates is available by clicking here. Anyone who has consumed any of the recalled fresh produce -- which includes veggie trays, shaved and chopped vegetables, rice dishes, various slaws, and salad kits -- and developed symptoms of Listeria infection should immediately seek medical attention and tell their doctors about the possible exposure to the bacteria. It can take up to 70 days after exposure for listeriosis symptoms to develop, so anyone who has eaten the recalled products should monitor themselves for the coming weeks. Symptoms can include fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Listeria monocytogenes can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems, including cancer patients and organ transplant recipients. Mann Packing is fully cooperating with U.S. and Canadian health officials on this recall, according to the company's news release.

The articles, in a supplement of the International Journal of Infectious Diseases, involve Salmonella, Hepatitis A and suspected anthrax. They are accepted conference abstracts that were to be presented at the International Congress on Infectious Diseases in September 2020 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. However, the event was cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. The first is an outbreak of ceftriaxone-resistant Salmonella Typhi attributed to eating chicken at a hotel in Tiruchirappalli, India in 2018. Link to hotelIn May 2018, India's National Centre for Disease Control's antimicrobial resistance surveillance network was notified by the Tamil Nadu State Surveillance Unit about ceftriaxone-resistant Salmonella Typhi cases in Tiruchirappalli city, central Tamil Nadu. Researchers defined a case as occurrence of culture positive Salmonella Typhi with ceftriaxone-resistance in a resident of Tiruchirappalli city, during January to June 2018. They were identified by reviewing records of hospitals and laboratories. Based on descriptive epidemiology and a few patient interviews, scientists hypothesized that eating at a hotel could be a potential exposure and tested this with a case-control study. A second such study was done to identify the food caused the outbreak. Seven of 51 typhoid case-patients had ceftriaxone-resistance. The age range was 12 to 42 years old and five were men. All seven had fever and hospital stays ranged from four to 23 days. Five of the seven cases reported eating food at a hotel prior to illness. Incidence of ceftriaxone-resistant typhoid was higher among patients who ate at this hotel than controls. Incidence of ceftriaxone-resistant typhoid were higher among cases who ate chicken gravy at the hotel than controls. Food handlers did not have typhoid carrier status. ""The cluster of ceftriaxone-resistant Salmonella Typhi was due to eating chicken gravy at a hotel in central Tamil Nadu. We recommended proper processing of chicken and continuing surveillance for ceftriaxone-resistance,"" said researchers. Hepatitis A infectionsThe second study reported a Hepatitis A outbreak with Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Poona infection in south India. The outbreak of Hepatitis A with salmonellosis occurred in an urban settlement of Vellore, India between July and August 2019. In June 2019, researchers observed clustering of jaundice cases in a pre-established cohort, and conducted an outbreak investigation, interviewing children and adults, from clusters of identified cases. Between April and August 2019, they identified 58 cases of jaundice. Of these, 57 were children younger than age of 15, with one aged 19 years old. A total of 24 children with jaundice received a blood culture. Two of the cultures grew Salmonella Typhi, and one Salmonella Poona. ""Our findings highlight that hepatitis A infection can present as sporadic outbreaks in communities with sub-standard water and sewage systems, along with the co-infection of other enteric infections such as invasive salmonellosis,"" said researchers. They also said population-based surveillance for hepatitis A is required in India, to identify people and geographical regions at risk, and potentially plan strategies for vaccination. Water buffalo meatFinally, in March 2017, a field investigating team was sent to Cayapa Village, Abra, Philippines because of increasing reports of foodborne illness. Twenty-nine suspected cases were identified with an age range from 6 to 77 years old and 15 were males. All ate water buffalo meat. Clinical manifestations were abdominal pain, fever and diarrhea. Interviews revealed that a water buffalo was butchered and sold amongst the villagers. All 11 serum specimens and five soil samples were negative for Bacillus anthracis. Researchers said findings indicate a point source outbreak of gastrointestinal Anthrax. ""Though, bacterial isolation were both negative for human specimen and environmental sample, all clinical manifestations were consistent with Bacillus anthracis rather than other foodborne bacterial pathogens,"" they said. An educational campaign was conducted with information that sick or dead animal by-products should not be sold or eaten and need to be properly handled and disposed of.

Canadian food safety officials posted the recall yesterday, warning consumers to check their homes for the implicated Randsland brand ""Super Salad Kit"" sold in plastic bags and through it away. The Nova Scotia company distributed the recalled salad kits to New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island.  Consumers can determine whether they have the recalled salad mix by looking for the following label information: ""Food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes may not look or smell spoiled but can still make you sick,"" according to the recall notice posted by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).  Symptoms can take up to 70 days to develop, so anyone who has eaten any of the recalled salad mix should monitor themselves for symptoms in the coming weeks. Symptoms can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache and neck stiffness. No illnesses have been reported in relation to the recalled packaged, chopped salad mix.  ""Pregnant women, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk,"" according to the CFIA. ""Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, the infection can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth. In severe cases of illness, people may die."" Young children are also at high risk of serious infection if they consume the bacteria because their immune systems are not fully developed. Investigators discovered the Listeria contamination in the sample of salad mix as part of their work on Randsland's two previous Class 1 recalls earlier this month. Those recalls involved coleslaw on Aug. 3 and broccoli slaw. Canadian food safety officials also found Listeria monocytogenes in samples of those products.

CDC also reported the outbreaks led to 21 recalls of food products in 2014. Among the report's other findings: Single food categories associated with the most outbreak illnesses:   Single food categories associated with the most outbreaks:   There were 25 multi-state outbreaks, with specific types of foods determined in 16 outbreaks:   Most common locations Restaurants accounted for 485 outbreaks, or 65 percent, of outbreaks reporting a single location of preparation. Specifically, 394 restaurants with sit-down dining, were the most commonly reported locations of food preparation. According to the CDC report, foodborne diseases caused by known pathogens are estimated to result in about 9.4 million illnesses each year in the United States. Not all that many of the illnesses occur in the setting of a recognized outbreak. However, data collected during outbreak investigations provide insights into the pathogens and foods that cause illness. Public health officials, regulatory agencies and the food industry use data to create control strategies along the farm-to-table continuum that target specific pathogens and foods. As defined by CDC, an outbreak of foodborne disease is the occurrence of two or more cases of a similar illness resulting from ingestion of a common food. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories voluntarily submit reports of outbreaks investigated by their agencies using a Web-based reporting platform, the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) NORS also collects reports of enteric disease outbreaks caused by other transmission modes, including water, animal contact, person-to-person contact, environmental contamination and unknown modes of transmission. More about the multi-state outbreaks Of  the 864 outbreaks in 2014, only 25, or 3 percent, were multi-state outbreaks. The multi-state outbreaks resulted in 778 illnesses, or 6 percent, of all outbreak illnesses. Of multi-state victims, 194 of them, or 28 percent, required hospitalization. Multi-state outbreaks caused 11 deaths, which was 52 percent of all foodborne illness outbreak deaths. Outbreaks involved a median of five states with a range of  2-29. Eleven outbreaks were caused by Salmonella. The serotypes of Salmonella identified were Baildon, Braenderup, Enteritidis, Javiana, Minnesota, Newport, Paratyphi B variant L(+) tartrate(+), Saintpaul, Stanley, Typhimurium, and multiple serotypes for one outbreak each. Ten multistate outbreaks were caused by Shiga toxin-producing E. coli. The E. coli serogroups identified were O157 for six outbreaks, and O103, O111, O121 and O145 each with one outbreak. Three outbreaks were caused by Listeria and one by norovirus. The foods implicated in Salmonella outbreaks were almond and peanut butter, cantaloupe (suspected), cashews (suspected), chia seed powder, cucumber, grapes (suspected), ground beef (suspected), mango (suspected), mini cucumbers (suspected), mini peppers (suspected), and mung bean sprouts. For E. coli, implicated foods included ground beef in four outbreaks with one confirmed and three suspected.  Serogroups O157 and O145 were identified in three and one of those outbreaks, respectively. Other E. coli implicated foods were cabbage with serogroup O111, clover sprouts  with O121, leaf lettuce with O157, pre-packaged salad with O157, spinach (suspected) with O157, and an undetermined food from a Mexican- style chain restaurant with O103.

And it puts the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in an enviable position with no currently active Listeria outbreaks. Among the foodborne diseases, Listeria is known for its high fatality rate. According to CDC, an estimated 1,600 people get listeriosis each year, mostly from eating food, with death the result for about 260. When two or more people get the same illness from the same contaminated food or drink, the event is called a foodborne disease outbreak. CDC went most of last year without an active Listeria outbreak to investigated. Then on Oct. 3, 2018, it learned Johnston County Hams Inc. in Smithfield, NC had recalled ham products for possible contamination with the Listeria bacteria. The outbreak associated with the Johnston County production was declared over on Dec. 18, 2018, but not before one of the four infected people died. The public also learned of last year's second Listeria outbreak from a recall. On Nov. 20, 2018, ready-to-eat pork products were recalled for possible Listeria contamination by Long Phung Food Products. Four people in four states were sickened and hospitalized, but all survived. CDC announced that the second outbreak was over on Jan. 29, 2019. And that left CDC with no active Listeria outbreaks to investigate. Since both of last year's Listeria outbreaks involved meat products, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) assisted CDC in the investigations as did state public health and regulatory officials. The recalled Long Phung Food Products included all pork patty rolls produced on various dates from May 21, 2018, to Nov. 16, 2018. An undetermined amount of recalled pork patties were shipped to distributors and retailers throughout the nation. In closing out the outbreak, CDC said it is still possible contaminated product could be in home freezers. CDC told FSIS about a cluster of cluster of listeriosis illnesses that were ""closely related"" on Oct. 22, 2018. The investigation linked the Listeria monocytogenes illnesses to the ready-to-eat pork products produced by Long Phung Foods. Four people in four states were infected with the outbreak strain of Listeria monocytogenes. The Listeria specimens from the four infected individuals were collected from July 1, 2017, to Oct. 24, 2018. Both the epidemiologic and laboratory evidence pointed to the Long Phung products as the likely source of the outbreak. Whole genome sequencing of investigative samples collected from the Long Phung Foods facility on Nov. 19, 2018, were closely related genetically to Listeria monocytogenes from the ill people, FSIS reported. All four victims were women, ranging in age from 35 to 84. Pregnant women and their newborns, adults over age 65, and people with the weakened immune system are more likely to get listeriosis. Anyone with a higher risk for Listeria infections should not eat refrigerated pate or meat spreads from a deli or meat counter. Avoid eating hot dogs, lunch meats, cold cuts, other deli meats or sausages unless they are heated to 165 degrees Fahrenheit. The public health investigation used the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may have been part of the outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory laboratories coordinated by CDC. Matching illnesses to the outbreak strain is accomplished with DNA ""fingerprinting"" of Listeria bacteria using whole genome sequencing (WGS). Illnesses from a common source of infection are closely related genetically. According to CDC, anyone who thinks they may have stored contaminated pork in a refrigerator or freezer should thoroughly wash and sanitize all drawers and shelves. Listeria bacteria is sometimes very difficult to remove. Long Phung's parent company, known as the 165368 C. Corporation, announced this list of recalled products. CDC used the same tools-DNA fingerprinting, PulseNet, and whole genome sequencing (WGS)-to name Johnston County Hames as the source of Listeria contamination in 2018's first Listeria outbreak.   That led to the great ham recall of 2018, which was known for removing such name hams from the market as: The outbreak led to the recall of hams that were produced between April 3, 2017, through Oct. 2, 2018. The four people stricken by the first outbreak were from 70 to 81  years of age, half male and half female.   All four required hospitalization and one, a Virginia resident who lived at an assisted living facility, died. Through routine inspections, deli ham samples were collected from Johnston County Hams in both 2016 and 2018.  The product from both years was found closely related genetically to Listeria strain that caused the outbreak infections.  The results provided more evidence that people infected in the outbreak were contaminated from eating the deli ham. (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

A variety of retailers in Ontario received the implicated products. About E. coli infectionsAnyone who has eaten any of the implicated products and developed symptoms of E. coli infection should seek medical attention and tell their doctor about their possible exposure to the bacteria. Specific tests are required to diagnose the infections, which can mimic other illnesses. The symptoms of E. coli infections vary for each person but often include severe stomach cramps and diarrhea, which is often bloody. Some patients may also have a fever. Most patients recover within five to seven days. Others can develop severe or life-threatening symptoms and complications, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). About 5 percent to 10 percent of those diagnosed with E. coli infections develop a potentially life-threatening kidney failure complication known as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Symptoms of HUS include fever, abdominal pain, feeling very tired, decreased frequency of urination, small unexplained bruises or bleeding, and pallor. Many people with HUS recover within a few weeks, but some suffer permanent injuries or death. This condition can occur among people of any age but is most common in children younger than five years old because of their immature immune systems, older adults because of deteriorating immune systems, and people with compromised immune systems such as cancer patients. People who experience HUS symptoms should immediately seek emergency medical care. People with HUS will likely be hospitalized because the condition can cause other serious and ongoing problems such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, brain damage, and neurologic problems.

When the business re-opened at the beginning of the 2019 financial year, a review was started. Offers receivedA Tiger Brands stock market statement said this found the business was ""not an ideal fit within its portfolio"" and that consideration should be given to exiting the category. It confirmed there had been ""several indicative offers"" and a formal due diligence process has been started ahead of a final decision being made. Company officials said the actions do not affect its commitment to the class action legal process which is underway. In April this year, owners of Tiger Brands said they planned to fight the lawsuit relating to the company's part in the outbreak. The first stage of the process deals with liability. Damages would be handled at a second stage if the court finds the firm liable. The firm of Richard Spoor Attorneys are representing more than 1,000 people affected by the listeriosis outbreak. The Seattle firm of Marler Clark LLP is serving as a consultant for the case attorneys. Earlier this year, Tiger Brands issued subpoenas to food testing laboratories for information on the identities of those who submitted samples for listeriosis testing and results of these tests during the outbreak period. This action is separate to, but has the potential to delay, the main litigation. No hearing is planned for this year but it could happen by mid-to-late 2020.

Another point made clear in an outbreak investigation report released yesterday puts the FDA firmly on record when it comes to antiquated shipping and receiving recordkeeping used by many in the leafy greens industry. Scott Gottlieb, commissioner for the Food and Drug Administration, issued a blunt statement calling for growers, processors and distributors to do the right thing.   Gottlieb said what consumer groups and industry observers have been saying for months -- traceback efforts to determine the specific romaine behind the outbreak were ""challenging"" because most of the necessary records were hand written and/or were not available electronically. Those out-of-date methods resulted in the FDA and CDC telling the public to avoid all romaine grown in the Yuma, AZ, area earlier this year because specific growers and shippers could not be identified.  ""We strongly encourage the leafy greens industry to adopt traceability best practices and state-of-the-art technologies to help assure quick and easy access to key data elements from farm to fork,"" Gottlieb said. ""We also strongly encourage the leafy greens industry to explore modern approaches to standardized record keeping and the use of additional tools or labels on product packaging that could improve traceability."" Portions of the investigation memorandum posted yesterday have been blacked out by the government. Much of the redacted information appears to be specific locations of growing fields and possibly names of romaine growers and processors. The E. coli O157:H7 outbreak this spring sickened 210 people across 36 states, hospitalizing 96 patients. Five people died, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of the laboratory-confirmed patients, 27 developed a type of kidney failure known as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). It was the largest E. coli outbreak in the United States since the 2006 outbreak traced to fresh spinach.    In a response to the FDA's report, the CEO of the California Leafy Greens Marketing Agreement (LGMA) organization said the industry is committed to producing safe food. Members of the California group, as well as its counterpart organization in Arizona, are operating under new rules for the 2018-19 season. The changes imposed on the voluntary members include requirements for daily cleaning of equipment and increasing buffer zones between animal feedlots and fields used to grow lettuce and other fresh produce commodities. Growers in the Yuma area began planting this season's romaine in late August and expect to begin harvest later this month. ""The FDA report highlights areas of concern and opportunity for collaboration,"" CEO Scott Horsfall wrote on the California organization's website. ""LGMA members know a lot about keeping leafy greens safe and we are continually working to improve our program so that consumers can continue to enjoy leafy greens with confidence."" FDA Commissioner Gottlieb also stressed the need for collaboration. He thanked those in the leafy greens industry for the assistance they provided during and after the outbreak, but said ""more must be done on all fronts to help prevent future foodborne illness outbreaks."" Enforcement is one of those fronts. ""The agency is taking steps to improve our response times and provide actionable information to consumers as quickly as possible,"" Gottlieb wrote.  ""We are also looking at our regulatory options and considering appropriate enforcement actions against companies and farms that grow, pack, or process fresh lettuce and leafy greens under insanitary conditions."" Toward that end, the FDA plans to undertake a temporary sampling program to collect and analyze romaine lettuce for contamination. Gottlieb promised if samples are found to be contaminated, the FDA will follow-up with leafy greens processors and their growers or suppliers to determine whether to remove the romaine from the marketplace.   Not the first time, or the second, or the third ...Following the 2006 spinach E. coli O157:H7 outbreak that sickened at least 205 people, hospitalizing 104 and killing four, the California and Arizona leafy greens industry implemented self-imposed regulations. Those changes were inadequate, according to the FDA officials. ""FDA and our partners at CDC identified 28 foodborne illness outbreaks of Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC) with a confirmed or suspected link to leafy greens in the United States between 2009 and 2017. This is a time frame that followed industry implementation of measures to address safety concerns after a large 2006 outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 caused by bagged spinach,"" according to the Environmental Assessment report and accompanying memorandum released yesterday by the agency. The apparent failure of the revised food safety protocols for the LGMA members also earned a mention in a Nov. 1 letter sent to produce industry groups and state officials in California and Arizona. Two of the FDA's top food safety officials -- Deputy Commissioner for Foods and Veterinary Medicine Stephen Ostroff, M.D., and Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs Melinda K. Plaisier -- sent the letter to say more revisions are needed. ""... our approaches to prevent leafy greens contamination must change to protect public health,"" Ostroff and Plaisier wrote. ""The safety of raw whole and freshcut (e.g., bagged salad) leafy greens is a longstanding issue. As far back as 2004, FDA issued letters to the leafy greens industry to express our concerns about outbreaks associated with this commodity. Leafy greens are mostly consumed raw, without cooking or processing steps to eliminate microbial hazards. Therefore, the way they are grown, harvested, packed, held, processed and distributed is crucial to ensuring that contamination with pathogens is minimized."" Canal water most likely spread bacteriaThe FDA's Environmental Assessment (EA) report says traceback identified 36 fields on 23 farms in the Yuma growing region as having supplied romaine lettuce that was potentially contaminated and consumed during the outbreak. Many of the romaine growers used water from an open canal near Wellton in Yuma County. The investigators began the environmental assessment in June, finishing their work in August. Samples collected from a 3.5-mile stretch of the open canal were positive for the relatively rare outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7. Investigators tested water from the Colorado River, which feeds the canal, but did not find the outbreak strain.  ""This strain of E. coli O157:H7 was not detected in any other (environmental) samples collected during this EA, although other human pathogens were found in these samples,"" according to the FDA report.  By the time investigators were on the scene in the growing area, the romaine fields had been tilled in preparation for future use, making soil sampling virtually useless. However, they visited farms that potentially shipped contaminated romaine and, when appropriate, sampled those fields and adjacent areas. During interviews, though, investigators began to suspect contaminated water as the most likely vector for the deadly E. coli. ""... based on interviews with growers and pesticide applicators, plausible explanations include direct application of irrigation canal water to the lettuce crop or the use of irrigation canal water to dilute crop protection chemicals applied to the lettuce crops through both aerial and land-based spray applications,"" according to the environmental assessment report. Growers and industry representatives have repeatedly said the contamination could have been the result of a perfect storm of unusual weather conditions. The FDA report says a freeze in late February likely led to damage of some portion of the romaine crop, which ""may have rendered it more susceptible to microbial contamination."" Overall, though, the FDA soundly debunked the weather theory.   ""Growers suggested weather events in the Yuma growing region may have contributed to crop contamination. The (environmental assessment) team considered the possibility that leaf freeze damage and dew on romaine leaves created conditions favorable for windborne contamination of the crop with dust carrying the outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7,"" the FDA report says. ""While this type of STEC contamination has been demonstrated (Berry et. al, 2015), it does not explain the presence of the outbreak strain in a free-flowing irrigation canal months later when there was little wind in the region."" Feedlot probable origin of the E. coliInvestigators say there are some factors that point to a 100,000-head feedlot next to the romaine growing area as the most likely source of the E. coli bacteria that was found in the canal water. For example, the timing of the illnesses, which began in early March, suggests the outbreak strain may have been present in the irrigation canal months before the investigators collected water samples. Or, the outbreak strain may have been repeatedly introduced into the irrigation canal along the 3.5-mile stretch where the samples were collected.    ""A large concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO) is located adjacent to this stretch of the irrigation canal. The EA team did not identify an obvious route for contamination of the irrigation canal from this facility; in addition, the limited number of samples collected at the CAFO also did not yield the outbreak strain,"" the FDA reported  ""Other possible explanations for how the irrigation canal became contaminated are possible, but the EA team found no evidence in support of alternative explanations."" Some people outside government and industry have speculated the E. coli came from human sources, such as field workers. That wasn't the case, according to the investigators, who specifically state human beings are not ""chronic carriers"" of the pathogenic serotypes of the bacteria. However, the intestinal tracts of ruminant animals such as cattle are ""well-established reservoirs for E. coli O157:H7,"" according to the FDA report. ""Various fresh water sources, including municipal well, and recreational water, have been the source of E. coli O157:H7 infections in humans, as has contact with colonized animals at farms or petting zoos. However, most E. coli O157:H7 infections in humans occur from consuming contaminated food.""    Also supporting the theory that the canal water was contaminated by the feedlot was the discovery that sections of the Wellton irrigation canal are unlined. Groundwater could be seeping into the canal in those sections. Shallow ground water is also pumped directly into the irrigation canal at two locations, according to the FDA report. ""Based upon Bureau of Reclamation hydrologic data, including a Bureau of Reclamation Wellton Area Groundwater Map, the EA team determined that ground water under the Wellton-area CAFO most likely flows from the southeast towards the northwest,"" the FDA reported. ""This roughly aligns with groundwater flowing from the CAFO area toward the unlined sections of the Wellton irrigation canal that are upstream of the CAFO in terms of irrigation canal flow."" Bureau of Reclamation staff told FDA the section of canal is not lined because ""ground water upwelling damaged the previous cement lining.""  The Yuma growing area includes fields in California's Imperial Valley, according to the FDA. In July investigators collected and tested water from three irrigation canals there that serve Imperial County farms that were identified during the outbreak traceback efforts. ""... all three of these irrigation canals have CAFOs near them. Six strains of E. coli O157:H7, each genetically distinct from each other, were detected at one canal water site (Spruce Main Delivery 49/50) in Imperial Valley, although none match the outbreak strain,"" the FDA reported.

",N/A,romaine lettuce,Contaminated canal water,E. coli O157:H7,210,"Yuma, AZ"3527,"Beginning today, the FDA is accepting comments on proposed guidance designed to improve the safety of fresh sprouts, which have been responsible for at least 50 outbreaks in the past two decades. The proposed guidance would apply to all entities in the food supply chain, from seed producers through distributors and on to those who grow and sell fresh sprouts. Guidance from the Food and Drug Administration includes suggested practices. If entities wish to follow other procedures, they must document that those processes are as effective as the FDA's guidance. Using international and domestic best practices data, the FDA developed the guidance ""Reducing Microbial Food Safety Hazards in the Production of Seed for Sprouting"" as part of its increased focus on prevention rather than response. ""The FDA is committed to taking swift action to respond to outbreaks related to sprouts and keep our food supply safe, but we also know that measures to prevent issues from happening in the first place are an important element of protecting consumers,"" said Frank Yiannas, FDA deputy commissioner for food policy and response.  ""By studying outbreaks related to sprouts over the years, we have been able to recommend changes in the industry to help lower the incidence of sprout-related outbreaks. Today's new draft guidance is another critical step, like the Sprout Safety Alliance or sprout-specific requirements of the Produce Safety Rule, the agency is taking to prevent illnesses related to sprouts."" Investigators linked 50 foodborne illness outbreaks to fresh sprouts between January 1996 and August 2018. Two of those outbreaks sickened more than 100 people in the United States just this past year. Overall, in the 22-year period, more than 2,600 people were confirmed with illnesses. Studies indicate that contaminated seed is the likely source of most sprout-related outbreaks, according to the FDA's statement about the proposed guidance. Sprouts are particularly likely to harbor and grow foodborne pathogens because of the conditions under which sprouts are produced -- time, temperature, water activity, pH and available nutrients -- are also ideal for the growth of pathogens. If seeds have not been grown, handled, stored and distributed properly, they can easily harbor foodborne pathogens that thrive when the seeds are sprouted. Pathogens such as E. coli, Salmonella and Listeria grow especially well in the conditions used to sprout seeds, Yiannas said in the FDA announcement. In developing the draft guidance, the FDA considered three documents related to food safety and hygienic production of seed for sprouting: the Codex Code of Hygienic Practice for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Annex II, Annex for Sprout Production; the International Sprout Growers Association-Institute for Food Safety and Health's ""U.S. Sprout Production Best Practices""; and the European Sprouted Seeds Association Hygiene Guideline for the Production of Sprouts and Seeds for Sprouting. Elements of all three documents are among the provisions in the FDA proposed guidance. The guidance states that if a grower, holder, conditioner, or distributor ""reasonably believes that its seeds are expected to be used for sprouting, we recommend that the grower, holder, conditioner, or distributor take steps that are reasonably necessary to prevent those seeds from becoming contaminated."" Although they are generally not consumed as seeds, seeds that are used for sprouting are considered food under federal law. Fresh sprouts present such high risk and are produced in conditions unique compared with other fresh produce, the FDA has a special subset of rules for them. The Produce Safety Rule, which FDA was required to develop as part of the 2011 Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), includes sprout-specific requirements.  ""However, we consider the seeds used for sprouting to be outside the definition of 'covered produce' under the rule, and activities such as growing, conditioning, and distributing seeds to be outside the scope of 'covered activities' in the rule,"" according to the FDA announcement. ""Therefore, we did not prescribe specific requirements in the Produce Safety rule to prevent the introduction of known or reasonably foreseeable hazards into or onto seed during growing, harvesting, conditioning, or holding of seed."" FDA wants all firms in the sprout seed supply chain take steps to reduce microbial food safety hazards in seed for sprouting, including training personnel who have food safety responsibilities. The agency also wants sprout businesses to have separate storage arrangements for seed intended to be used for fresh sprouts. Sprout seed businesses should also ensure that food contact surfaces are cleanable and cleaned regularly. The federal government is accepting comments on the proposed sprout draft guidance from the public, businesses, academia and all other interested parties. During the 60-day comment period, comments can be submitted online, by fax, by personal courier or regular mail. The deadline is Aug. 26.

Following shutdown and cleaning, all tests at the Baja production site were negative for the presence of Listeria monocytogenes, according to a statement from Greenyard Frozen, which is part of the multinational Greenyard Group. The follow-up tests were performed by the company with external experts including Campden BRI and confirmed by the Hungarian authorities' own analysis. Greenyard did not give a restart date but said it would be in the short term with more information being released in coming weeks. Company officials previously said they decided to stop production to do an in-depth review and would not restart or release the freezing lines until they found and eliminated the root cause of the Listeria contamination. Illnesses were reported in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Implicated frozen products were distributed to 116 countries and have a long shelf-life (some until mid-2020). In late June, the Hungarian Food Chain Safety Office (NEBIH) banned the marketing of certain frozen products made by the plant between Aug. 13, 2016, and June 20, 2018, and ordered a product withdrawal and recall. The factory had been under increased official control since March this year and no frozen vegetables from the 2018 production season were distributed. Greenyard revealed its restart plans in a trading update where it revised its fiscal year (AY) 2018-2019 profitability guidance. The firm previously estimated cost of the recall at $35 million (EUR30 million). Company officials said the figure includes costs for the product, transportation, handling, storage, destruction, subcontracting, lower cost absorption of the factory, and loss of margin. The company is insured for recall costs and possible product liability damages. Hein Deprez, Greenyard's CEO, said the recall and related costs will negatively impact financials for AY 2018-2019. ""Despite only a slight decrease in sales, this quarter was marked by longer than expected pricing pressure and competition in our markets, unforeseen factors such as the recall for the potential Listeria contamination and the exceptional weather circumstances,"" he said. ""Based on new forecasts...we revise our profitability guidance for AY 2018-2019, well below last year's profitability, and have implemented action plans to restore profitability going forward. Moreover and in view of deleveraging Greenyard's balance sheet, the Board of Directors has requested management to review the strategic options of its business portfolio."" The company forecasted that underlying full year recurring earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (REBITDA) will be about 25 percent below last year's profitability, instead of reaching a 10 percent REBITDA growth versus last year. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) said the outbreak is thought to have started in 2015. Initially, the suspected food source was limited to frozen corn but further investigations expanded this to include other frozen vegetables. Listeria monocytogenes IVb sequence type (ST) 6 that matched the outbreak strain from victims was isolated from frozen spinach and frozen green beans sampled at Greenyard's Baja facility. It was also isolated in a sample from a floor drain at the packaging area confirming environmental contamination of the processing plant. The same strains of Listeria monocytogenes were detected in frozen vegetables produced by the company in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Listeriosis is an infection caused by Listeria monocytogenes bacteria. New cases may be identified due to the long incubation period, which is up to 70 days, the long shelf life of frozen vegetables, and possible future consumption of implicated product bought before the recall.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) told Food Safety News that, as of this afternoon, McCain Foods had been identified as the supplier in all of the corn-related recalls the agency has posted in recent days.  The recall notices say the corn is potentially contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella bacteria, but they do not include the name of the corn supplier or any details about how the contamination occurred. All of the recall notices say no confirmed illnesses have been reported. Yesterday, Oct. 18, the Midwest grocery chain Hy-Vee named McCain Foods supplied ingredients for fresh meat, poultry, and potato products under recall from all of its 245 stores across eight states. The recall notice says the ingredients from McCain, caramelized mushrooms and dried tomatoes, are potentially contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella. The Food and Drug Administration posted the Hy-Vee notice today, with McCain named as the supplier. All of the recall notices, whether or not they provide the name, say the supplier involved notified the recalling company of the potential contamination. McCain Foods, headquartered in Ontario, Canada, is a privately owned multinational company specializing in frozen foods, especially potato products such as french fries and other vegetables. The company has many business customers, including other food companies, retailers, restaurants and institutional foodservice operations such as school districts. As of today, the McCain website does not appear to have any information on its public pages regarding the corn, mushroom or tomato recalls. However, a blogger, Ammon Collinwood, has posted what he says is an Oct. 15 recall notice issued by McCain for its fire-roasted black bean corn blend because it could be contaminated with Listeria and Salmonella.

The implicated Josie's Organics prepackaged baby spinach had a best-by date of Oct. 23, 2021. As of Jan. 6, a total of 15 people had been confirmed sick from the outbreak strain of E. coli, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The sick people were spread across 10 states. No deaths were reported, but four patients required hospitalization, and three developed a life-threatening kidney failure complication called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). No deaths were reported.  ""The true number of sick people in this outbreak was likely much higher than the number reported, and this outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for E. coli,"" the CDC reported. Illnesses started on dates ranging from Oct. 13, 2021, to Nov. 8, 2021. Sick people ranged in age from 1 to 76 years, with a median age of 26, and 80 percent were female.  State and local public health officials interviewed people about the foods they ate in the week before they got sick. Of the 13 people interviewed, a total of 11 reported remembering eating spinach. Public health investigators used the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that were part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole-genome sequencing (WGS). WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples were closely related genetically. This suggests that people in this outbreak got sick from the same food. Officials in Minnesota found the outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 in a package of leftover Josie's Organics baby spinach collected from a sick person's home. FDA conducted a traceback investigation for the positive product sample and traced it back to a small number of farms in two different geographic regions. However, investigators did not identify a potential point of contamination. Whole-genome sequencing of bacteria from 15 people's samples predicted resistance to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. These findings do not affect treatment guidance since antibiotics are not recommended for patients with E. coli O157:H7 infections. About E. coli infections Anyone who has developed symptoms of E. coli infection should seek medical attention and tell their doctor about their possible exposure to the bacteria. Specific tests are required to diagnose the infections, which can mimic other illnesses. The symptoms of E. coli infections vary for each person but often include severe stomach cramps and diarrhea, which is often bloody. Some patients may also have a fever. Most patients recover within five to seven days. Others can develop severe or life-threatening symptoms and complications, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). About 5 to 10 percent of those diagnosed with E. coli infections develop a potentially life-threatening kidney failure complication, known as a hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Symptoms of HUS include fever, abdominal pain, feeling very tired, decreased frequency of urination, small unexplained bruises or bleeding, and pallor. Many people with HUS recover within a few weeks, but some suffer permanent injuries or death. This condition can occur among people of any age but is most common in children younger than five years old because of their immature immune systems, older adults because of deteriorating immune systems, and people with compromised immune systems such as cancer patients. People who experience HUS symptoms should immediately seek emergency medical care. People with HUS will likely be hospitalized because the condition can cause other serious and ongoing problems such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, brain damage, and neurologic problems.

The flour recalled in the 9-state outbreak of relatively rare E. coli O26 has a long shelf life, and it is likely still stored in many a home and restaurant pantry. Consumers should review the brands of recalled flour. The outbreak, as measured by the onset of illnesses, extended from Dec. 11, 2018, to May 21, 2019, infecting a total of 21 people. Three required hospitalization, but there were no deaths. The E. coli O26 outbreak linked to flour led to the recall of several brands and types. The CDC advises consumers to avoid using any of these recalled products: Brand Castle Mixes On June 21, 2019, Brand Castle LLC of Bedford Heights, OH, recalled several brands of cookie and brownie mix because the flour used in them was potentially contaminated with E. coli.  The following Brand Castle mixes, sold in 25-ounce and 32-ounce glass jars, were recalled: Pillsbury Best Bread Flour On June 14, 2019, Hometown Food Co., a customer of ADM Milling Co., announced a recall of 5-pound bags of Pillsbury Best Bread Flour with UPC Code 0 5150020031 5 and the following lot codes and use-by dates: King Arthur Flour On June 13, 2019, King Arthur Flour Inc., a customer of ADM Milling Co., announced a recall of 14,218 cases of 5-pound bags of King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour. You can identify recalled flour by looking for the following best-used-by dates and lot codes on the bag's side panel, below the nutrition facts box: ALDI Baker's Corner All Purpose Flour On May 23, 2019, ALDI, in association with ADM Milling, recalled all 5-pound bags of Baker's Corner All Purpose Flour. In declaring the outbreak over, CDC also repeated its cautions about contaminated flour and raw dough: CDC: Consumers should not use any of the recalled flour. Throw it out. CDC: Eating raw dough can make you sick. CDC: Clean up thoroughly after baking. CDC: Contact your healthcare provider if you think you may have become ill from eating raw dough. CDC: Restaurants and other retailers should not use, sell, or serve any of the recalled flour. Restaurants and other retailers should always be safe with raw dough. Again, as of July 11, CDC said the outbreak appears to be over. It was linked to flour by both epidemiologic and laboratory evidence.  CDC made these additionl points about the O26 outbreak: (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

Testing of fresh produce, meat and other foods from Chipotle restaurants has not provided investigators with much insight, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Testing of multiple food items collected from Chipotle restaurant locations did not identify STEC O26 (E. coli),"" the CDC reported today. ""When a restaurant serves foods with several ingredients that are mixed or cooked together and then used in multiple menu items, it can be more difficult for epidemiologic studies to identity the specific ingredient that is contaminated."" Some sources have suggested beef from Australia as the source of the E. coli, but no such link has been found by the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. ""As was stated by CDC earlier today, we've examined the evidence and have not been able to identify a source for these outbreaks,"" an FSIS spokesperson said. ""Distribution data shared by Chipotle does not establish a link between Australian beef, or any single source of beef, and the Chipotle restaurants where case patients reported consuming steak. Moreover, of the 60 case patients only eight reported consuming steak. ""During this (investigation), Chipotle committed to several steps to improve sanitation practices and record-keeping in their supply chain and in their restaurants, including better record-keeping and improved employee training."" Chipotle's stock was up more than 5 percent in early trading today as investors anticipated what the company's executives have been saying for more than two weeks -- that the two outbreaks that spanned 14 states and sickened 60 people are a thing of the past. The announcement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention today fits the Chipotle marketing campaign outlined by founder and co-CEO Steve Ells and other executives in mid-January. They told attendees at an investment conference the public would quickly forget about the outbreaks and that profits would be bigger than ever. Ells said media reports about the outbreaks had confused customers in recent months, but he said the new ad campaign launching in mid-February would not reference food safety problems or actions Chipotle took to avoid them in the future. The chain's stock was trading at $754 in August 2015 and hit a low of $404 in January. Multiple financial and investment publications speculated during the last weekend of January that the public and mainstream media had already forgotten about the E. coli outbreaks, which were the fifth and sixth foodborne illness outbreaks for the restaurant chain in the second half of 2015. Hundreds of Chipotle's customers were victims of those outbreaks:   The FDA conducted tracebacks of multiple widely-distributed ingredients, according to an agency update posted late today. ""No product of interest was identified. Even without a definitive item to follow, the FDA traced back to their origins some widely distributed ingredients in an effort to identify a source for the outbreak. Unfortunately, the distribution path did not lead to an ingredient of interest,"" the agency reported. ""The FDA also conducted investigations of some suppliers, but did not find any evidence that those suppliers were the source of the outbreak. Ultimately, no food item has been identified as causing the outbreak, and by the same token, no food has been ruled out as a cause.""

Anyone can become sick with a Salmonella infection. Infants, children, seniors, and people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of serious illness because their immune systems are fragile, according to the CDC. Anyone who has eaten any of the implicated salad and developed symptoms of Salmonella infection should seek medical attention. Sick people should tell their doctors about the possible exposure to Salmonella bacteria because special tests are necessary to diagnose salmonellosis. Salmonella infection symptoms can mimic other illnesses, frequently leading to misdiagnosis. Symptoms of Salmonella infection can include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating contaminated food. Otherwise, healthy adults are usually sick for four to seven days. In some cases, however, diarrhea may be so severe that patients require hospitalization. Older adults, children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients, are more likely to develop a severe illness and serious, sometimes life-threatening conditions. Some people get infected without getting sick or showing any symptoms. However, they may still spread the infections to others. (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)

Authorities are investigating six illnesses across three counties where the restaurant chain has locations, according to a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Health. She said the department will not consider naming the restaurant chain until laboratory tests from foods and victims are available. Standard epidemiological investigative techniques are underway. Public health staff is working on traceback of possible food sources. They are also interviewing sick people who ate at the suspect restaurant chain to narrow down possible foods. Anyone who has eaten out in recent days and developed symptoms of E. coli food poisoning should seek medical attention and tell their doctors of the possible exposure to the bacteria. Food contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 may not look or smell spoiled but can still cause illness. Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, mild to severe abdominal cramps and watery to bloody diarrhea, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Young children and some elderly victims are at risk of developing hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a severe and sometimes fatal complication of an E. coli infections. HUS strikes approximately 5 percent to 10 percent of STEC-infected children under the age of 10 years, affecting the kidneys, digestive system and other organs. HUS is fatal in 3 percent to 5 percent of cases, while other HUS victims may suffer long-term consequences of their illness, including hypertension or impaired kidney function.

Fratelli Beretta USA Inc. of Mount Olive, NJ, is recalling 24-ounce trays containing two 12-ounce packages of ""Fratelli Beretta UNCURED ANTIPASTO PROSCIUTTO, SOPPRESSATA, MILANO SALAMI &amp; COPPA"" with best by dates of Aug 27, 2021, through Feb 11, 2022. The products are marked with the UPC number 073541305316 and have an establishment number ""EST. 7543B"" printed on the packaging next to the best by date. The products are labeled as ready to eat, according to the recall announcement posted by the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service. The ready-to-eat (RTE) uncured antipasto meat trays were produced from Feb. 28, 2021, through Aug. 15, 2021. There are 862,000 pounds of product subject to this recall. Because of the long shelf life of the meat product there is concern that consumers may have it in their homes. Consumers are advised to check the label information of any product they have on hand. If the codes match the recalled products the meat should immediately be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been investigating a combined outbreak of Salmonella Infantis infections and an outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium infections and found a link to Fratelli Beretta products. Combined, the outbreaks are responsible for 36 illnesses in 17 states with 12 hospitalizations and no deaths. As of Aug. 26 the data for the two outbreaks is being reported together because the investigations have been combined. No new cases have been reported since the previous notice on Aug. 24. ""Epidemiologic data show that Fratelli Beretta brand prepackaged ""Uncured Antipasto"" trays may be contaminated with Salmonella and may be making people sick,"" according to the CDC's outbreak alert. Some ill people reported eating Fratelli Beretta brand uncured antipasto before they got sick and the traceback investigation confirmed that some of the ill people purchased uncured antipasto trays produced by Fratelli Beretta USA Inc., according to the CDC.

Over the course of the outbreak, nearly 30 people were hospitalized and two developed life-threatening hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). After reports of illness tied the restaurant to the outbreak in August, the restaurant voluntarily closed for three days to clean all surfaces and bring in new food. The county then performed a full inspection and passed the restaurant, allowing it to reopen on Aug. 5. A routine inspection on Sept. 5 recorded one violation. To encourage customers to return, Federico's has announced that it will offer free breakfasts and dinners on Sept. 16 at all of its locations. And, in response to the impact E. coli can have on kidneys, the chain also plans to donate 20 percent of gross sales from Sept. 30 to the Arizona chapter of the National Kidney Foundation. The exact source of the illness at the Litchfield Park Federico's has not been identified. Findings from the Maricopa County Department of Public Health report are not expected for several months.

Most of the 14 illnesses have been reported from New Hampshire (10), with two reported from Massachusetts, one from Maine, and one from Vermont, FSIS added. Traceback for 11 people for whom data were available led back to a single slaughter date at PT Farm, the agency stated. FSIS continues to work with the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services on this investigation and will provide updated information as it becomes available. Previous coverage follows: That E. coli O157:H7 illness cluster in New Hampshire, which has grown to 14 cases, is now connected to a recall of about 8,800 pounds of raw beef products by PT Farm LLC in North Haverhill, NH. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) said the recalled products may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7. The raw, intact and non-intact beef product items including ground beef, ground beef patties and other sub-primal cuts, were produced between June 6 and June 16. The following products are subject to recall:   The products subject to recall bear establishment number ""M8868"" inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations and for institutional use in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont. FSIS was notified about the New Hampshire E. coli O157:H7 illness cluster on July 20. Working in conjunction with the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, FSIS determined that there is a link between the beef products from PT Farm and this illness cluster. Based on epidemiological investigation, 14 case-patients have been identified with illness onset dates ranging from June 15 to July 10. Traceback for eight of the patients for whom data was available led back to a single day of production at PT Farm. This investigation is ongoing. FSIS continues to work with the New Hampshire health officials on this investigation and will provide updated information as it becomes available. E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps two to eight days after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children younger than five and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume beef products that have been cooked to a temperature of 145deg F for roasts with a three minute rest time and 160deg F for ground meat. The only way to confirm that beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.

The CDC is working with officials in Mexico and in several U.S. states on an investigation of a multistate outbreak traced to raw oysters. Various pathogens, including Vibrio, Shigella, E.coli, Campylobacter and norovirus, have sickened people in at least five states, according to the warning posted today by the CDC. All of the federal and state health agencies in the United States have had standing warnings for years advising the public to not eat raw oysters because of the dangers of viruses, parasites and bacterial contamination. The danger increases in warmer months because water temperatures become more comfortable growth mediums for the pathogens.  Illnesses (in the current outbreak are) linked to raw oysters harvested from Estero El Cardon estuary in Baja California Sur, Mexico. On May 6, DiCarlo Seafood Wilmington of California recalled some oysters harvested from Estero El Cardon, posted a limited recall. On May 7, Estero El Cardon was closed to further oyster harvesting pending investigation. Yesterday the Food and Drug Administration posted a public warning about contaminated oysters from SOL AZUL, S.A. DE C.V. that were shipped to California. ""Mexico implemented a precautionary closure of the growing area on May 7, 2019, as a result of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and other gastrointestinal illness concerns,"" according to the FDA's warning. ""On May 8, Mexico was informed a Shigella outbreak was confirmed. The growing area implicated remains closed while authorities investigate the cause and the extent of the outbreak, to ensure implicated shellfish is removed from the food supply."" From Dec. 16, 2018, through April 4 this year, 16 people in the United States have been confirmed with infections as part of the outbreak. Of the 15 patients with the information available, two were so sick they had to be admitted to hospitals. Patients range in age from 26 to 80 years old. Sixty-seven percent are male. Additional patients are expected to be identified through whole genome sequencing and other laboratory methods, which can match pathogen strains from food samples to those identified in samples from sick people. Also, it can take several weeks from the onset of symptoms for patients to be logged by the CDC because of the lag time between initial laboratory testing and the federal agency receiving confirmed reports from state and local health officials. ""Laboratory testing on samples from patients identified multiple pathogens causing infections. Some people were infected with more than one pathogen,"" the CDC reported today. ""(Some of the) ill people reported eating raw oysters sold by restaurants in California and Nevada."" Illnesses have also been confirmed in Illinois, New Hampshire and Alaska. Patient counts by pathogen or illness as reported by the CDC are: Don't ignore illnessesThe CDC, FDA, and state and local health officials urge people to seek medical attention if they become ill after eating raw oysters. Any illness should also be reported to the local health department. E. coli and Vibrio infections are particularly dangerous because they stand a better chance of producing serious complications such as kidney failure, brain damage, amputations and death.
