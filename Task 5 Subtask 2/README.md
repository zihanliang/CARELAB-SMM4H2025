### Overview
- **Task:** The system is designed to extract various entities (e.g., organizations, products, diseases, safety incidents, and numbers) from input text. It uses a BIO (Begin, Inside, Outside) tagging scheme to label tokens.
- **Model:** It leverages a pre-trained BERT model (specifically "bert-base-cased") that is fine-tuned for token classification. A classification head is added on top of BERT to predict the label for each token.

### Data Preparation
- **Data Input:** The data is provided in CSV format. Each row contains a text string along with several columns, each corresponding to different entity types.
- **Entity Mapping:** A dictionary maps CSV columns (like "organization" or "product") to corresponding entity types (e.g., TARGET_ORG, PRODUCT). This allows the code to determine which entity to label when a match is found.
- **Label Definitions:** A list of labels is defined that includes "O" for non-entity tokens and BIO-prefixed labels (e.g., "B-PRODUCT", "I-PRODUCT") for entities.
- **Entity Extraction:** A helper function scans the text for occurrences of the entity substrings (extracted from the CSV) and returns their start and end positions along with the corresponding entity label.

### Tokenization & Label Alignment
- **Tokenization:** The input text is tokenized using the BERT tokenizer. The tokenizer also returns offset mappings (the character start and end positions for each token) so that labels can be accurately aligned.
- **Label Alignment:** 
  - The code creates character-level labels for the entire text (initially marking every character as "O").
  - When an entity is found in the text, the first character is labeled with a "B-" tag (beginning of the entity), and subsequent characters receive an "I-" tag.
  - These character-level labels are then mapped to token-level labels based on the token offsets. Special tokens (like [CLS] and [SEP]) are given a label of -100 so that they are ignored during training.

### Model Architecture
- **BERT Backbone:** The model uses BERT as its underlying architecture. BERT processes the tokenized input and produces contextualized embeddings for each token.
- **Classification Head:** On top of these embeddings, a token classification head is added. This head outputs a probability distribution over the predefined labels for each token.
- **Label Mapping:** The model is configured with the number of labels and mappings (from label names to IDs and vice versa) to properly interpret the outputs.

### Training & Evaluation
- **Training Setup:** 
  - The script uses the Hugging Face Trainer API with specified training arguments (learning rate, batch sizes, epochs, etc.).
  - Dynamic padding is handled via a dedicated data collator, ensuring that sequences in a batch are padded appropriately.
- **Token-level Evaluation:** The evaluation computes metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy at the token level using the seqeval library.
- **Event-level Evaluation:** Beyond token-level metrics, the system aggregates token predictions into complete entity chunks (or "events"). It then compares these aggregated predictions with the gold-standard annotations to compute an exact match rate for the entire entity extraction process.

---

### Advanced Analysis
- **Confusion Matrix:** The code constructs a confusion matrix that excludes tokens labeled as "O" to focus on the entity predictions.
- **Classification Report:** A detailed classification report is generated for non-"O" tokens, offering insights into the performance on each entity type.
- **Chunk-Level F1:** Finally, the script also computes chunk-level (or entity-level) F1 scores by converting the predictions and true labels into sequences (ignoring special tokens) and evaluating them using seqeval.

### Overall Idea
The code establishes a full pipeline for entity extraction:
1. **Data Preparation:** It reads and preprocesses CSV data, extracting entities based on defined mappings.
2. **Tokenization and Labeling:** It accurately aligns character-level annotations to the tokenized output, a crucial step for training a robust sequence labeling model.
3. **Model Training:** It fine-tunes a pre-trained BERT model on the prepared dataset using a well-configured training loop.
4. **Evaluation:** It offers both token-level and entity-level evaluation metrics to comprehensively assess model performance.
5. **Analysis:** Advanced evaluation (confusion matrices and classification reports) provides deeper insights into the model’s strengths and weaknesses.

This modular approach ensures that every step—from data preprocessing to final evaluation—is clearly defined, enabling both efficient training and detailed performance analysis.
