The code implements a sophisticated text classification pipeline specifically tailored for distinguishing food safety articles into three classes: "Food Recall", "Foodborne Disease Outbreak", and "Neither". It combines state‐of‐the‐art transformer models with custom data processing, engineered text features, custom loss functions, multi-head classifiers, and advanced post‐processing techniques. Here’s a breakdown of the key components and how they work together:

---

### 1. Data Preparation and Feature Engineering

The code handles data in several steps to prepare it for classification:

- **Label Mapping:**  
  - A dictionary maps string labels to numeric IDs (e.g., `"Food Recall"` → 0, `"Foodborne Disease Outbreak"` → 1, `"Neither"` → 2).

- **Enhanced Dataset:**  
  - The `EnhancedDataset` class inherits from PyTorch’s `Dataset` and is responsible for preparing text data.
  - It tokenizes the input text using a pre-trained tokenizer (from RoBERTa-large).
  - It applies optional data augmentation (selecting between original and augmented text based on a probability).
  - It dynamically extracts engineered features from the text. These features include:
    - **Text Length:** A normalized measure.
    - **Keyword-based Flags:** Boolean indicators marking the presence of food recall and outbreak-related keywords.
    - **Neither Indicator:** A composite flag determined by the absence of those keywords.
  - The custom collate function (`enhanced_collate_fn`) aggregates these features along with standard tokenized inputs into batches.

### 2. Custom Loss Function: Class-Balanced Focal Loss

- The `CBFocalLoss` class implements a variant of focal loss that is adjusted (or “rebalanced”) based on the effective number of samples per class.
- This loss function:
  - Applies class-specific weights to help with imbalanced data (notably, the “Neither” class is given a higher weight).
  - Uses a focusing parameter (gamma) to reduce the influence of well-classified examples, which helps in learning difficult or minority classes.

*Purpose:* The focal loss mechanism, combined with class weighting, allows the model to focus on harder-to-classify examples and handle class imbalance more effectively.

### 3. Enhanced Model Architecture

The core classifier is implemented in the `EnhancedClassifier` class and showcases several advanced strategies:

- **Transformer Encoder Integration:**  
  - It uses a pre-trained RoBERTa-large model to extract rich contextual embeddings from the input text.

- **Feature Fusion:**  
  - If additional text features are enabled, these are processed through a feature projection network and then fused with the transformer’s [CLS] token representation.
  - A fusion layer further integrates these features with the main text representation.

- **Dual and Auxiliary Classification Heads:**
  - **Main Classifier:** Produces logits for the three classes.
  - **Neither-Specific Classifier:** Generates a separate score (or “boost”) intended to emphasize the detection of the “Neither” class.
  - **Auxiliary Classifier:** Acts as a regularizer by providing additional guidance during training.
  - **Binary Classifier:** Specifically trained to distinguish between “Neither” and the other classes.
  
- **Temperature Scaling:**  
  - The logits are scaled by a temperature parameter before being combined with the auxiliary classifier output. This helps in calibrating the model’s confidence.

- **Loss Combination:**  
  - The overall loss is a weighted sum of:
    - The main focal loss,
    - An auxiliary cross-entropy loss,
    - A binary cross-entropy loss for the “Neither” head, and
    - An additional loss component for the neither-specific classifier.

*Purpose:* This multi-head architecture and the bespoke combination of losses provide specialized attention to the "Neither" class, which is often the minority and hardest to detect accurately.

### 4. Training and Evaluation Pipeline

- **Data Balancing:**  
  - Before training, the training data is aggressively oversampled (especially for the “Neither” class) to mitigate class imbalance. An oversampling function creates additional copies of minority class samples.

- **Training Setup:**  
  - Training arguments (e.g., learning rate, batch sizes, number of epochs, etc.) are defined using a modified `TrainingArguments` structure.
  - The custom trainer (based on Hugging Face’s Trainer) is set up with callbacks (like early stopping) and the custom collate function.

- **Metrics Computation:**  
  - During evaluation, the function `compute_metrics` calculates a variety of metrics (accuracy, macro and weighted precision, recall, and F1 scores) and prints a detailed classification report.
  - Special care is taken to handle the “Neither” class separately in the metrics.

### 5. Advanced Prediction, Uncertainty Estimation, and Post-Processing

- **Uncertainty Estimation with Monte Carlo Dropout:**  
  - For uncertainty estimation during prediction, dropout is enabled at inference time. Multiple forward passes (Monte Carlo samples) are used to compute the mean output and uncertainty (via predictive entropy).
  
- **Rule-Based Post-Processing:**  
  - After obtaining predictions, additional linguistic rules are applied:
    - Keywords and heuristic rules may override predictions if the text strongly indicates that the article should belong to the “Neither” class or if the prediction uncertainty is high.
    - Short texts or texts with certain indicative phrases may lead to prediction adjustments.
  
- **Multi-Model Ensemble:**  
  - The code includes functions to train multiple models with varied configurations (different seeds, oversampling ratios, and hyperparameters) to capture diverse perspectives.
  - A weighted ensemble prediction method aggregates the outputs (soft probabilities) of these models.
  - Special rules are applied to boost or adjust the “Neither” predictions based on the ensemble’s combined outputs.

*Purpose:* These advanced techniques aim to improve robustness and calibration by incorporating uncertainty measurements, ensemble learning, and rule-based adjustments to handle edge cases effectively.
