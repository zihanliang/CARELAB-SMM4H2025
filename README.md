### CareLab at #SMM4H-HeaRD 2025: Insomnia Detection and Food Safety Event Extraction with Domain-Aware Transformers

This repository contains all source code and documentation for our submission to the **[#SMM4H-HeaRD Shared Tasks](https://healthlanguageprocessing.org/smm4h-2025/)**, specifically addressing:

- **Task 4**: Detection of insomnia and evidence spans from clinical notes
- **Task 5**: Extraction of entities and events related to foodborne outbreaks and recalls from news articles

Our systems cover both classification and span-level extraction tasks, combining rule-based and transformer-based approaches. All code, preprocessing scripts, and evaluation utilities are included, organized by task in their respective folders.
